Apply the tools and concepts required to complete a LSSGB project.\n2. Manage self and others to complete a project.\n3. Effectively communicate project process and results.\n\nThis course is designed to individually mentor students through the final steps required to complete the\nCal Poly Lean Six Sigma Green Belt Certification. For certification candidates that meet the\nprerequisites listed below, this course adds:\n\n1. Verification that the candidate has successfully completed the prerequisite requirements.\n2. Coaching on completing the work experience requirement.\n3. Real time mentoring as the candidate completes a Lean Six Sigma Green Belt Project.\n\nUpon successful completion of this course, a candidate only needs verification of the 120 hour related\nwork experience to be Certified as a Cal Poly Lean Six Sigma Green Belt. Overall certification includes:\n\ne 11303 Lean Six Sigma Green Belt Course (taken separately)\n\n \n\n \n\nSyllabus - Lean Sigma Green Belt Cert12.docx Page 1\nEric Olsen Cal Poly — Orfalea College of Business — Central Coast Lean\n\no 80 hours of online training\no Completion of a Mini-Project\no Successful completion of a 3 hour online exam\n\ne 120 hours of lean six sigma related work experience (completed separately prior to or\nconcurrent with this course)\n\ne Amentored Green Belt level project (this course)\n\nThis course may be completed entirely online, although occasional physical meetings with the course\ninstructor are encouraged.\n\nPrerequisites The following prerequisites are minimum requirements for acceptance in this course. It is\nrecommended that potential candidates contact the instructor (eolsen@calpoly.edu) prior to enrolling\nin the course to make sure all prerequisites are in order. Green Belt projects typically take 3-9 months to\ncomplete. Project completion feasibility should be considered prior to enrollment.\n\n1. Successful completion of the Cal Poly Lean Six Sigma Green Belt Course with the following\nminimum grades:\n\ne Online Quizzes: 80% weighted average\ne = Mini-Project: 80%\n\ne Online Final Exam: 80%\n\ne Course grade overall: B-\n\n2. Draft Project Charter for the required Green Belt Project. A Project Charter form is included as\nAppendix C. This should be reviewed with the Instructor (eolsen@calpoly.edu) prior to\nregistering for this course. It is the candidate’s responsibility to find an acceptable project for\nthis course.\n\n3. Read the Singo Model Handbook.\n\nThe student may submit a formal appeal to waive select perquisites with the approval of the instructor\nand demonstration that deficiencies are adequately addressed.\n\nMentored Lean Six Sigma Green Belt Project For certification, each candidate must complete a\nsignificant Green Belt level project. The project is “mentored” and must be completed under guidance\nof the course instructor. The minimum required elements of the project are listed under “Green Belt\nRequirements Project 1” in Appendix A. Note that theses are the minimum requirements and that\nadditional tools and analyses may need to be applied to properly address the Project Charter.\n\nProject tracking software from MoreSteam (https://www.moresteam.com/traction/index.cfm ) is\nprovided to the candidate as part of the certification process.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nCOURSE MATERIALS\n\n \n\nA.

Shingo Model Handbook provided by instructor.\n\noO\n\n \n\n \n\nPERFORMANCE EVALUATION\n\n \n\nEvaluation based on the candidate’s meeting the minimum acceptable performance criteria for the\ncertification elements covered in this course:\n\n1. Completion of stage gate review for each stage of the DMAIC process (i.e. Define, Measure,\nAnalyze, Improve, Control).\n\n2. Demonstrated competency in all the tools indicated in Appendix A.\n\n3. Project Results Report. See Appendix D for requirements.\n\n \n\n \n\nPOLICIES AND PROCEDURES\n\n \n\nTime Expectation This is an independent, fixed start course selected by the candidate based ona\nreasonable expectation that the project can be completed in a specified period of time. Having\npreviously taken the IT303 Lean Six Sigma Green Belt course, the student would have a relatively clear\nview of expectations. They would also do some pre-work and speak to the instructor (mentor) about\n\nthe feasibility of completing the projects on time. Completing a draft project charter (see Appendix C) is\na prerequisite and part of the course admission process. The course duration is set at 1 quarter.\nHowever, typical Green Belt project run 3-9 months in duration. At the end of each quarter the\nstudent will either complete the course or receive a “RP” for a grade is reasonable progress is being\nmade.\n\nIn a case where the project is not completed prior to graduation, a grade will be assigned based on\npercent completion and the quality of work to that point.\n\nCertification can be completed while enrolled at Cal Poly or within 5 years of completing the online\ntraining course (IT303) if no longer enrolled.\n\nPersonal Integrity Policy The penalty for cheating is expulsion from the course. Cheating occurs when\nyour take credit for work that you did not do. Plagiarism occurs when students copy sections of another\nauthor’s material without referencing it. | am a strong believer in accessing resources and discussing\nproblems outside the course, but be sure to give credit where credit is due.\n\n \n\n \n\nSyllabus - Lean Sigma Green Belt Cert12.docx Page 3\nEric Olsen\n\nCal Poly — Orfalea College of Business — Central Coast Lean\n\nAPPENDIX A\n\nCal Poly Certification Project Requirements\n\n \n\nProject\nResults\n\nSummary statement of project\nresults tying metric performance\nback to Charter statement mission.\n\nx<\n\nx<\n\n \n\nDefine\n\nProject Charter\n\nThought Process Map\nS-I-P-O-C Process Flow Map\nPareto Chart\n\nGantt Chart\n\nCTQC Tree Diagram\n\nCTQCs Identified with Operational\nDefinition\n\n<x KK KK XK\n\nx<\n\n<x <x KKK Xx\n\nx<\n\n \n\nMeasure\n\nMeasurement System Analysis\nTrend Chart\n\nDefect Opportunities Identified\nDPMO Baseline and sigma Level\nHistogram\n\nStatistical Process Control\n\nCapability Analysis\n\n \n\nAnalyze\n\n \n\nHypothesis Testing\n\nDesign of Experiments: Full\nFactorial or Fractional Factorial\nDesign\n\nx |< KK KKK OX\n\nNA\n\n<|x<x KKK KK XK\n\nx\n\n \n\n \n\nSelect from the following tools:\nCause & Effect Diagram\n5-Why, 1-How Analysis\nFMEA - Failure Mode & Effects\nAnalysis\nRegression & Correlation Analysis\nOne-Way ANOVA\n\n \n\nSelect 3\n\n \n\nSelect 4\n\nNA\n\n \n\nSyllabus - Lean Sigma Green Belt Cert12.docx\n\nPage 4\nEric Olsen\n\nCal Poly — Orfalea College of Business — Central Coast Lean\n\n \n\nImprove\n\nSelect from the following tools:\n\nBrainstorming\n\nError-Proofing\n\nSystem Dynamics\n\nSolution Selection Matrix\nCorrective Action Matrix\nPiloting Changes\n\nSet-up Reduction\n\nSelect 4\n\nSelect 4 NA\n\n \n\nControl\n\nControl Plan\n\nControl Chart(s) showing both\nBEFORE and AFTER data\n\nx\n\nx\n\nx\n\nx\n\n \n\nSelect from the following tools:\n\nRevised Work Instructions\n(Standard Work)\n\n5-S\nTotal Productive Maintenance\n\nBest Practices - Improvement\nIntegration\n\nSelect 3\n\nSelect 3 NA\n\n \n\nAffidavit\n\n \n\nSigned by organization executive\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSyllabus - Lean Sigma Green Belt Cert12.docx\n\nPage 5\nEric Olsen Cal Poly — Orfalea College of Business — Central Coast Lean\n\nAPPENDIX B\n\nTollgate Review Questions?\nGood questions to direct projects.\n\nDEFINE\n\n1.

It’s goal is to present certain\nenvironmental material, their interrelationships, and human interactions with that\nenvironment. The course will review certain biophysical components (e.g., soils,\nvegetation) that give a site its identity. We will also review built elements (e.g.,\nroads, buildings) that should be considered when conducting a site analysis. The\nlocation of those elements and their relationship to each other create patterns in\nthe landscape that provide clues about a place\'s complexity, fragility and potential.\nNatural and introduced elements typically come together at sites to create complex\nsystems. These systems tell us stories about the ways that humans might\ninteract there. Questions about a site can be answered only if we take the time to\nunderstand the land\'s complexities. Typical questions are:\n\n« What is the \"value\" or \"worth\" of a site? To whom? Why?\n\n* Is alandscape suitable for development? Is it not?\n\n* Is it a sensitive place worth preserving?\n\n« Are there opportunities and/or limitations that might restrict some activities?\n\nGrowth and Development creates varying degrees of environmental impacts that\nultimately can cause environments to change. Undesired landscape change can\noccur when people do not take the time to fully understand the interrelationships of\nthe various systems.\nOur Objective ... therefore, is to learn as much as possible about complex site\nsystems. By doing this, we can minimize negative disruptions through design\nprinciples based on ecological sustainability. In other words, we must develop a\nholistic approach. In summary, we are seeking to identify a process capable of\nproducing a sense of fit between humans and a land\'s characteristics. That\nprocess need not be a standardized or inflexible approach. As landscapes are\nunique, we need to modify the process to fit a site, and a project\'s goals.\n\ncourse objectives ...\n\n1. study a landscape analytically and holistically so as to better understand the\ncomplex web of relationships that exist in biophysical systems,\n\n2. use cognitive observation skills when studying a landscape at varying scales of\ninvestigation,\n\n3. analyze and manipulate mapped information in a way that is useful for\nenvironmental design, planning, and decision making, and,\n\n4. comprehend the requirements necessary to plan for the sustainability and bio-\ndiversity of an ecosystem in both rural and urban environments.\n\ncourse structure ...\n\nLA114/LA213 has been organized in a lecture-studio-site activity format. Lectures\n\nin the studio will generally present the bulk of the information. Some material will;\n\nhowever, be presented on-site, or around the campus. Therefore, it is critical that\nyou attend all scheduled class activities.\n\nActive Learning will be encouraged and expected. Our job will not be to give you\nknowledge related to site analysis. It will be to help you learn all you can about\nsites, so that in the future you can analyze places in the context of sound planning\nand design. We need to; therefore, become a learning team this quarter.\n\nThe course calendar identifies lecture topics, readings and due dates. Lectures\nwill be followed by a studio period, where exercises can be developed. Studio\ntime will be in the lab, or on-site. Be prepared to take walks! Studio time is not for\nlectures, but to support lectures. Studio time may include discussions, site visits,\ncritiques, presentations and/or slides. As exercises will be developed during that\nperiod, it is imperative that students attend and participate in the studio.\n\ncourse exercises ...\n\nDuring the quarter, we will work on a series of exercises aimed at exploring ideas\nrelated to site analysis. We will usually take site tours before starting an exercise.\nFor the first two weeks we will focus our energies on sites in and around Cal Poly\nor San Luis Obispo. These will be individually reviewed on-site. After this review,\nstudents will be given assignments based on what was discussed on-site. After\nthis first two-weeks, the quarter’s primary site, an area near the entrance of Poly\nCanyon, will be presented. This site is presently being used for several activities;\nhowever, it has been proposed as a location for a new dormitory facility that could\nhouse up to 2700 students. Our challenge this quarter will be: 1) to develop a\ngood understanding of issues related to natural and built site elements, 2) to learn\nabout site interrelationships, and 3) to document physical/cultural aspects that\nmight make sites suitable for some intended use(s).\n\ncourse requirements ... *\n\nExercise One: (individual) 5.00% of grade\nExercise Two: (individual) 5.00% of grade\nExercise Three: Soils and Slope (group) 10.00% of grade\nExercise Four: Hydrology and Erosion (group) 10.00% of grade\nExercise Five: Biotic Communities (group) 10.00% of grade\nExercise Six: Microclimate (group) 10.00% of grade\nExercise Seven: Site Context/Visual Character (group) 10.00% of grade\nFinal Project (group) 10.00% of grade\nTest One (individual) 15.00% of grade\nTest Two (individual) 15.00% of grade\ntotal oe 100.00% of final grade\n\n* The faculty reserves the right to revise the grade distribution.\n\ncourse reading material ...

Ask questions when things are not clear. Many times in a group\nsituation we do not want to ask questions for fear that our classmates will think\nthat we are not intelligent. It has been our experience that the more a person asks\nquestions, the more engaged they are. This is the time in your life to ask\nquestions without fear of criticism. But, this does not mean that the studio should\nbe a forum to vent your anger or to ask questions that put others on the spot.\n\nOne of the main reasons an instructor is hired is because he/she has some\nspecial talent in a given subject. This talent typically has been honed over years of\nexperience. When one of us gives a student a grade and/or feedback on a project,\nit is given in the spirit of trying to help the student learn and to further develop their\ndesign skills. And, it is given in the spirit of honestly telling the student what we\nthink about a submission. Critiques consist of not only finding areas where a\nstudent has not implemented certain principles, they also illustrate where design\nprinciples have been effectively implemented.\n\nWe want to help you this quarter. But you must understand that learning is a two-\nway street. Your interest and participation is a requirement for growth. When we\noffer criticism and/or advice this quarter you should take it in the spirit of academic\nexploration, and not try to make it more than it is intended to be. There should be\nmutual respect and professional courtesy given at all times to both faculty and to\nstudents during all classroom activities. Research has shown that positive\nclassroom interaction provides a fertile field for learning.\n\nclass participation ...\n\nActive class participation is expected and will factor into your grade. You should\nexpect the class to extend for the full period of time as published in the Class\nSchedule. The course is such that you will have assignments, due dates, lab\nexercises, etc. at a variety of times. This will require the transfer of information and\npotential schedule updates which may change the original due dates previously\nannounced.\n\nThrough mutual agreement we may choose to modify some of the meeting times\nand due dates. It will be your responsibility to be in class during the agreed upon\nhours to hear of any changes and/or additions. It is imperative that you be in class\nto receive this information, as well as faculty feedback and reviews. We want this\nquarter to be both an informative and exciting part of your education. Your\nparticipation and interest will factor into the success or failure of this goal. Lets all\nwork to have a great quarter!\r'),

Knight, Physics for Scientists and Engineers , 3” Edition (or 2\"4 or 1\")\n\nExams:\nWe will have three exams throughout the quarter. Exam dates will be announced in class.\n\nHomework:\n\nThe homework is a critical part of understanding the material covered in this course. Physics can\nonly be learned by working many different types of problems. If you can\'t solve a problem the\nfirst time, have somebody show you how. At a later time, try working the problem again without\nlooking at the solution. The exam questions will be similar to the homework problems;\nconsequently it will be essential to understand the homework. Homework is due as announced in\nclass and will not be accepted after this date. In addition to the help I can provide during my\noffice hours, the learning center in 180-368 will be staffed with a physics faculty or tutor who can\nhelp you with the homework during the hours posted outside the door. Individual tutors are\navailable at a price by inquiring with the physics department office for a list. You can also sign up\nfor a study session at the Cal Poly portal.\n\nOn-Line Homework:\n\nThe on-line homework system, “mastering physics”, will be used during the quarter. To learn\nmore about creating an account and using this homework system look at the handout, using\n“mastering physics” available in class today and from my web page. To log on the first time you\nwill need our course ID number which I will e-mail to you soon.\n\nWorkbook:\n\nThe workbook will not be collected and graded. However, the workbook will help tremendously\ntowards focusing your reading and preparing you for the homework problems. I would\nrecommend working the corresponding workbook section after reading each section in the\ntextbook.\n\nActivities:\n\nThroughout the quarter we will be conducting experiments that are introduced in class and\nfinished outside of class. Since physics is an experimental science, my hope is these experiments\nwill increase your understanding of the material covered in lecture in the absence of a formal\nlaboratory experiment.\n\nGrading:\n\nYour final grade will be based on your overall performance in the class with the following\napproximate percentages: three exams (55/50%), homework and activities (15%), and final exam\n(30/35%).\r'),

All members\nof this class are expected to contribute to a respectful, welcoming, and inclusive environment for every other\nmember of the class.\n\nThere is an old adage that encourages those with questions to ask because others may have the same question;\nyou do not need some imagined quorum in order to validate your question or your request for assistance. If you\nhave a question or need assistance, that alone is sufficient. You belong here and your participation in the course\nis not only welcomed but encouraged.\n\nPersonal Well-being\n\nThere are times when coursework and non-academic obligations may conflate to create a seemingly unbearable\nsituation. During these times, your coursework may suffer and you may opt to not complete (or even attempt)\nan assignment; I understand this and you need not apologize for it. If this happens, do not get discouraged. The\ncourse is structured such that you can pick up with the next assignment (with some work to review what was\nleft incomplete).

You are responsible for any announcements posted on the course website.\n\nQ&A Forum\n\nI will maintain and regularly monitor a Piazza forum for questions about the assignments and the course\nmaterial. Questions with code specific to a solution should be made private, but general programming and\nconcept questions should be public to benefit all students.\n\nActivities\n\nClass Participation\nThe lectures are for your benefit. Ask questions. No, really, ask.\n\nLecture Comprehension Quizzes\n\nThere will be multiple low-risk quizzes to assess comprehension of lecture material. These will generally be\nmade available on Canvas on the day of each lecture with an extended period of time to complete them. Do pay\nattention to these deadlines; consider setting up notifications from Canvas.\nAssignments\n\nThere will be eight programming assignments. You will likely find that working on an assignment over\nmultiple sessions allows you to benefit from the powers of diffuse thinking.\nExams\n\nThere will be seven quizzes. The quizzes will cover general programming language concepts, the analysis and\nsynthesis of specific concrete programs, and material based on the assignments.\nJune 17, 2020 CSC 430 3\n\nGrading\nMastery Model\n\nGrading for this course is determined based on a version of the Mastery Model. Though this model may be\nunfamiliar, some will find it liberating. The basic idea is that it is more meaningful to demonstrate a high degree\nof mastery on a smaller set of core topics than a low degree of mastery on a larger set of topics. Moreover, this\nmodel allows for each student to work at a different pace to attain mastery of the course material with frequent\nfeedback from the instructor.\n\nThat said, we are, of course, constrained by the time frame of the quarter, so here is how this model is realized\nin this course.\n\nLogistics\n\ne The only hard deadline on assignments is the last day of instruction. The course schedule and website\ninclude recommended deadlines for pacing, but there is no deduction for submitting later.\n\ne Assignments can be corrected and resubmitted after each grading session. These grading sessions will\ngeneral occur within a couple of days after each recommended deadline.\n\ne Each quiz can be retaken (though with different questions) to improve your score. This can be done only\n\nduring the next quiz day or during the scheduled final exam time. As such, there is an implicit limit on\nthe number of times that one can retake a given quiz.\n\nMastery Levels\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nNote that the percentage scores required for each quiz/assignment below is per quiz/assignment, not an\naverage over the quizzes/assignments.\n| Grade Level Quizzes Assignments |\n| > 80% | > 90% | > 80% | > 90% |\n[A 17 rs |\n[B 16 7 |\n[Cc 14 13 |\n[D 14 15\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAs an example, to earn a C grade, you must earn at least a score of 80% on each of quizzes 1-4, and at least\na score of 90% on assignments 1-5.\nApproximate Percentage Allocation\n\nThe percentage breakdown below is not the final determination of your course grade (see above), but is\nprovided to allow you to track your approximate grade as the course progresses.

Students are not to exchange program code in any form (hardcopy or electronically).\n\nUsing solutions from any other source is forbidden (github is not a resource for studying); in particular,\nusing solutions (either instructor’s or other students’) from previous offerings of this course is not allowed. Using\nsolutions found on the Internet is not allowed. Referring to previous solutions while developing your solution is\nnot allowed.\n\nCollaboration that goes beyond a high-level discussion of general approaches will be considered cheating. If\nyou are unsure about what constitutes proper or improper collaboration, consult the instructor for guidance.\r'),

In the past, the study of an intriguing question\nsuch as why humans eat what they eat was confined to single aspects—such\nas anthropology, history, sociology, foodways, geography, biology, or\npsychology. In this course, we will illuminate culturally based food beliefs\nand practices from a multitude of perspectives. Hopefully, we will develop\nan appreciation for human differences, the precariousness of our current\nsituation, and the importance of developing tolerance and understanding.\nCLASSES: This course consists of 17 lecture / discussions, each with associated\nreading assignment(s). The student is expected to do the reading before\ncoming to class and to come prepared to participate in a discussion. Doing\nthe reading means reading the chapter at least twice. The questions will serve\npartly as a basis for the midterms.\n\nThe second half of each lecture will consist of 50 minutes devoted to\nbackground information about the culture, followed by a 5-minute break and\nthen a 55-minute discussion of the day’s reading.\n\nEXAMS: the examinations are Scantron tests and the questions are True/ False\nand multiple choice. Questions will focus on both halves of\nlecture—background material presented by the instructor, questions from the\nreading, and research questions. The final exam is longer than the midterms;\nits questions will be based on the questions from the two midterm exams.\n\nEXTRA-CREDIT: Occasionally, the instructor will announce evening\ntalks / panels that have something to do with culture. Students can earn up to\n1 point (final percentage point) extra-credit by attending the talk and writing\nup a synopsis. Like all other academic submissions, these should be double-\nspaced, typewritten. No hand-written synopses will be accepted. This\nbenefits both the student and the instructor, as occasionally assignments get\nlost and the student can just print it out again. Also, typewritten materials\nare a lot easier to read.\n\nQUIZZES: five quizzes will be given during the quarter, starting week two. If\nyou miss a quiz (or an exam) due to illness, you must present a doctor\'s excuse or\nsome other formal university excuse in order to make it up.\n\nSTUDENT PRESENTATIONS: starting Week Three (with Jewish Cooking) the\nfirst hour of each class will be run by a 5-student committee. Each student\nwill answer two of the 10 questions; who answers what should be agreed\nupon by members of the committee. Students are encouraged to conduct a\ndiscussion with other members of the committee and with others in the class.\n\nTo answer each question, the student is expected to draw primarily from the\nreading. However, answers are not complete if terms are not understood.\nFor example, in answering the question: “What rationale does Harris give for\nthe Levite banning of camel meat?” the student should say something about\nthe Levites. Who were they? When did they live?\n\nThe reading does not answer such questions, so the student presenter should\nfind the answer using Google or some other reference material.\n\nAfter the 5-member panel has covered the questions related to the reading, they\nthen present the research question, which should be a group effort. By group\neffort is meant that each and every student in the group talks about some aspect of the\nproblem. This can be presented using an overhead or a small Powerpoint\npresentation ona CD. Along with the presentation, the committee turns in a\n2-3 page report on the research question. The report should have\nsubheadings, and the student responsible for that section should type his or\nher name in the subheading.\nLike any academic submission that analyzes a particular question using outside\nsources, this paper should be typewritten, double-spaced, with a\nbibliography and citations to the bibliographic references. Failure to include a\nbibliography and citations will result in an automatic deduction of 20%.\n\nHere are some pointers for maximum effectiveness:\n\n1) Minimize the amount of material displayed on the overhead or\nPowerPoint slide. The rule of thumb is: 6X6, which means 6 lines with a\nmaximum of 6 words. Points will be deducted for not following this rule.\n\n2) Know your material: you should be able to make your presentation\nwithout relying heavily on notes. Keep your handheld notes as brief as\nwhat you display.\n\n3) Stand straight: do not slouch. Speak directly to the audience.\n\nFIELDWORK: this 2-3 page assignment gives the student to do a little “real-\nworld” research on his or her own. There are four possible approaches:\n\n1), Write a food diary for one week consumption of food. Record what\nyou eat, whom you ate it with, where, and other social context details.\nFinish with a half-page analysis of your eating habits (time of day;\nwhom you ate with; how often you eat with the TV on) and the quality\nof your diet (meat content; whether you meet the 5-a-day USDA\nguideline; fast-food; and fats) and any other details you want to\ninclude.\n\n2), Write up an interview with a senior citizen(s) in which you ask\nquestions about what they ate 50 years ago, what family meals were\nlike, what food ingredients were like, and how much food has changed\n\nsince then;\n\n3), Write up childhood food memories: what sorts of things you grew to\nlike and dislike at an early age and why; superstitions that people\nhave communicated to you about what to eat and when to eat;\nembarrassing moments at mealtime; what family meals were like\nduring your childhood and how they have changed. Do not include\ndetails that you would be embarrassed to have read in class (names\n\nwill not be mentioned.)\n\n4), If you lived in another country at some point in your life and you have\nsufficient information, you could write up your observations about\ntheir diet, particularly the importance of social eating, of reciprocity\n(sharing), what foods are common fare, what foods are special (e.g.\nreligious festivals), and any other observations that you would like to\nmake.\n\nVIDEOS: are provided to complement the readings and lecture. Tests will draw\nfrom the videos; it is expected that the student will take notes.\n\nWEB SITE: the student\'s attention is particularly directed to the course web\nsite, which has some of the readings for which I was not able to obtain\ncopyright permission. These are only available on the web site.\nSUBJECT\n\n \n\nQuality of presentation assessed on clarity, completeness, professional conduct, and\nquality of communication.

Math is not a spectator sport;\nyou have to explore and practice the material on your own. Actively participate in class by\nasking questions and seek help early if you are having trouble with the homework: from other\nstudents, or from me in office hours or class. The assigned homework should be considered as\na minimum number of problems to be worked; the problems are chosen to provide a reasonable\nsampling of the material. You are encouraged to work with other students while doing your\nhomework in order to foster a better understanding of the material. You should expect to\nspend an average of 2-3 hours studying for each lecture hour of class; hence the 25-35 hours\nper week program of the College of Science and Mathematics.\n\nReading Questions (10%): A short list of questions for each section of the text which will be\ndue at the beginning of the discussion of that section. The lowest two scores will be dropped.\nHomework and Quizzes (13%): Homework will not be collected; instead, a short (1-2\nquestion) quiz or in-class worksheet will be given most weeks (except for weeks with an exam).\nThe lowest quiz score will be dropped. Make-up quizzes will not be given; exceptions to this\ncan be made if arrangements are made prior to the beginning of lecture.\n\nMidterms (44% pts): There will be two in-class exams (22% each). Makeup exams will not\nbe given. Your lowest midterm score will be replaced by your final score (as a percentage) if the\nfinal score is higher. The midterms are tentatively scheduled for the following days (subject to\nchange with prior notice): Thursday, April 19th; Tuesday May 15th.\n\nFinal Exam (33%): Friday, June 8th, 1:10pm-4:00pm, same room as the lectures. The final\nexam is comprehensive. You must take the Final Exam at the scheduled time.\n\nEvaluation: Scoring above 90% / 80% / 70% / 60% is guarenteed to earn an A / B/C / D\ngrade, respectively. These percentage thresolds may be lowered slightly, but will not be raised.\n\nAcademic Honesty: The Cal Poly catalog summarizes the University’s policy regarding\ncheating and plagiarism: “As a student, you are responsible for your own work and you are\nresponsible for your actions.” Students who violate academic integrity will meet the stiffest\npossible penalties. The complete university policy on academic dishonesty can be found here:\nC.A.M. 684 http://www.calpoly.edu/~acadsen/documents/Cheating&Plagiarism.html\r'),

This creates a rich mix of experience and lean learners.\n\nThe class meets synchronously in-class and online every Monday and Wednesday from 2:00pm-4:00pm\nusing Zoom http://calpoly.zoom.us/. Students are encouraged to attend every session to ask questions\nand interact, but sessions are also recorded for later viewing. Guest speakers will be a regular feature of\nthe Wednesday session and will be the most interactive. The Monday sessions will be a “Movie Day”\nfeaturing the greatest hits of lean online movies and videos. Attendance as the Movie Day session is\noptional, but we will be discussing the movie afterwards and the discussion will NOT be available online.\nPhysical seating in the class is “open” to both in-class and online students with priority going to in-class\nstudents. Although this approach has yielded plenty of available seats in the past, we are still\nexperimenting. You can always participate online.\n\nStudents will be required to complete a “Quiz” for each session. The primary learning elements for the\ncourse are the online lectures and guest speakers, weekly online movies, the online MoreSteam training\nmaterial (see below), and an individual Lean Six Sigma Mini Project.\n\n \n\n \n\nCOURSE DESCRIPTION\n\n \n\nThis course is designed to familiarize students with the Lean Six Sigma process improvement\nmethodology and to provide them an opportunity to practice using Six Sigma Black Belt tools. It is also\nthe first step in the Cal Poly Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Certification process. A Lean Six Sigma Black Belt is\nan individual who is skilled in applying basic and advanced process improvement and project\nmanagement methods in order to complete projects that will result in significant, sustainable\nimprovements within an organization.\n\nOriginally developed by Motorola to improve quality in their manufacturing processes, Six Sigma has\nbeen adopted by companies throughout the world to improve all types of processes. When applied in\nbusiness environments, Six Sigma programs have been used to dramatically increase an organization’s\n\n \n\n \n\nSyllabus - Lean Sigma Black Belt34-1.docx Page 1\nEric Olsen Cal Poly — Orfalea College of Business — Central Coast Lean\n\nability to improve quality and customer satisfaction while reducing overall costs. Companies such as\nAlliedSignal and General Electric have used Six Sigma to significantly increase productivity, operating\nincome and cash flow.\n\nIn this course, students will gain an understanding of the strategy and deployment of Six Sigma Black\nBelt methods. After completing this course, you should be able to DO the following:\n\nCommunicate using Lean Six Sigma concepts.\n\nThink about an organization as a collection of processes, with inputs that determine the output.\n\nRelate Lean Six Sigma concepts to the overall business mission and objectives.\n\nUse the concept of a Sigma Level to evaluate the capability of a process or organization.\n\nUnderstand and apply the five-step D-M-A-I-C model as a framework to organize process\n\nimprovement activity.\n\n6. Employ a wide range of process improvement techniques, including Design of Experiments,\nwithin the D-M-A-I-C model.\n\n7. Recognize the organizational factors that are necessary groundwork for a successful Lean Six\n\nSigma effort.\n\nWU RWNPR\n\n8. Employ your Lean Six Sigma skills to lead a successful process improvement project delivering\nmeaningful results to the organization.\n\nPlease read: This course requires ADDITIONAL COST companion software from MoreSteam.com\nat https://www.moresteam.com/university/calpoly.cfm\n\n \n\nNote that to get access to the companion software as listed below you will need a discount code from\nthe course instructor (Eric Olsen eolsen@calpoly.edu) AFTER you complete a contract and pay $600 to\nCal Poly for the course as a fee.

Exercise and develop this important asset in this\n\ncourse. The penalty for cheating is an F for the course. Cheating occurs when:\n1. A student looks at other students\' work during a quiz or exam or obtains help of faculty or\nstudents outside their assigned group on assigned homework sets or exams.\n2. Astudent copies large sections of another author’s material without referencing it (plagiarism).\n3. Students share answers to online quizzes or individual homework assignments.\n\nIn contrast to cheating, | believe it is beneficial to work in pairs and groups to study, discuss, and\nunderstand the material. This is especially true in addressing “supplemental exercises” at the end of\neach section. Feel free to discuss the online content and supplemental exercises with your classmates\nor others to build your understanding of the material.\n\nYou are responsible for anything that is said in class or any changes made to assignments. Do not e-\nmail or call me asking, “What did | miss?” Find a buddy to share coverage responsibility. If your buddy is\nat a loss, please contact one of our two able Teaching Assistants before going to me. cc me if you like.\n\nYou are responsible for managing the inputs into your grade. The points are there. | do not give\nadditional projects to increase one\'s grade.\n\n \n\n \n\nINSTRUCTOR CAREER HIGHLIGHTS - ERIC OLSEN\n\n \n\nRESEARCH INTERESTS\nLean Thinking -- Strategy Deployment — Performance Measurement\n\nEDUCATION\n\nPh.D. Operations Management — 2004 The Ohio State University\nMaster of Business Administration - 1987 Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State U\nBachelor of Science, Forest Engineering - 1979 University of Maine at Orono\nINDUSTRY\n\nHewlett Packard / Agilent (Avago Tech) 1988 - 1999\nProduction Manager — Wireless Semiconductor Division Santa Clara, CA\n\nWorldwide Manufacturing Education Manager - Components Group\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSyllabus - Lean Sigma Black Belt34-1.docx Page 5\nEric Olsen Cal Poly — Orfalea College of Business — Central Coast Lean\n\nManager, Product Engineering - Optical Communication Div., Fiber Optic Mfg.\nManufacturing Development Engineer - Optical Communication Division, Fiber Optics\n\nLitton - Poly-Scientific 1982 - 1988\nManager Fiber Optic Engineering Blacksburg, VA\nSenior Engineer - Slip Ring Products\n\nCaterpillar Tractor Company 1979 — 1981\nTest Engineer — Product Development Center Peoria, Illinois\n\nRequirements for Lean Six Sigma Mini-Project\nNOTES:\ne Acopy of these instructions is also posted on the course website.\ne Consider making a Poster for extra class participation credit.\ne Review the grading rubric BEFORE completing this project to maximize your score (and\nlearning).\n\nObjective and Overview\n\nIt is important to exercise your knowledge to own it. This is especially true in the world of lean six sigma.\nTherefore, one of the requirements of this course is that you apply the concepts and tools that you are\nlearning from the MoreSteam online content to a real project. This is the “learn-by-doing” portion of\nthe course.\n\nYou shall select a process to improve and apply the DMAIC steps to that process. In the real world, you\nwould be working with a team and have a great deal of flexibility about which approach and tools you\nwould use to solve a problem. This project is to be completed on your own or possibly with the\nassistance of people involved in the process that you have selected (not your classmates). To manage\nand grade the large number of students taking this course, the documentation for the project is\nstandardized. The remainder of this document explains the basic project requirements. Questions will\nbe addressed during the weekly sessions.\n\nStep 1: Select a Process to Improve\n\n| suggest you complete at least the first four online sessions before you select a process. The best\nprocess to select involves a real world problem that you have a vested interest in solving. This is\nespecially true of work processes in your job or at an internship. Alternatively, you can propose any\nprocess that you are familiar with and have access to. Select a process that has an “outside” sponsor\n(not you) to work with. Consider whether the improvement of this process would look good ona\nresume or make the work life of you or associates better. Would you be able to use this an example of\nhow you have applied the DMAIC process in a job interview? Consider whether this process would help\nothers beside you. Ultimately, you need to strike a balance between doing a significant project that may\nbe big and complex, with a project that is simple enough to use as an explanation of the DMAIC process.\n\nOnce you have decided on a candidate process or two, be sure to review the rest of the project\nrequirements to be sure you have an idea how the project will roll out and which specific tools you\nmight use. Note that you may have to expand the scope of your project to apply all 10 tools. Also\nnote that applying all 10 tools may not necessary solve the problem you have identified. This is okay.\nThat is why we call it a “mini” project. If you don’t achieve a “solution,” at least you should achieve a\nbetter understanding of the problem. Your report and recommednations should still help the sponsor.\n\n \n\n \n\nSyllabus - Lean Sigma Black Belt34-1.docx Page 6\nEric Olsen Cal Poly — Orfalea College of Business — Central Coast Lean\n\nStep 2: Draft a Project Charter and Get Instructor Approval\n\nOne key tool in the Define stage of a project is the “Project Charter.” You are required to provide the\ninstructor with a rough draft Project Charter of your proposed project by the week specified in the\nblock plan of the class. You will not necessarily be able to insert all the required fields in the online form\n(see MoreSteam), but you should provide enough information to demonstrate to the instructor that you\nhave a high likelihood of success. Submit your Draft Project Chart as directed.\n\nStep 3: Create a Project Plan\n\nReview the “Lean 6 Sigma DMAIC Map (SIX SIGMA PROCESS IMPROVEMENT FLOWCHART)” in the\nsidebar of the MoreSteam training. You are required to apply a minimum of two tools to each DMAIC\nstage. Fortunately, the Project Charter counts as one tool in the Define stage. You are also required to\napply at least one “statistical tool” in your project. Examples of statistical tools include control charts,\nhypothesis tests, correlation analysis, capability analysis, and regression analysis.\n\nProject Plan Outline\nExecutive Summary\nRecommendation(s)\nDefine\n\n1.

Your interpretation is of the result to your SPECIFIC project (see “Thought Process Map”\n\nSession 1, Lesson 15).\n_>\n7 PRACTICAL\n\nSolution\n\n    \n \n\n \n   \n\n \n\n  \n \n  \n \n\n2.

Help\nis usually available at the end of each weekly session.\n\nStep 5: Compile your results\nPut all your tools and statements into one pdf document. Make sure:\n\nThe tools and statements are all in DMAIC process order.\n\nThe file name includes your name.\n\nAll pages are numbered.\n\nInclude a footer with the file name and your name.\n\nInclude an executive summary and recommendation as the first page of your project.\n\nWV RPWNR\n\nStep 6: Submit your results\nSubmit your pdf as specified by the instructor.\n\nMini-Project Grading Criteria — See the grading rubric on the course portal.\nThe following is a breakdown summary of the criteria that will be used in assessing your project:\n\nPoints Percent\n\n5 4% Project report submitted on time.\n5 4% Format and submission directions followed.\n10 8% Picture or organization logo included.\n10 8% Executive summary included, well executed, extra effort evident.\n8 6% Recommendations included, well executed, extra effort evident.\n5 4% Statistical analysis applied in one or more tools.\n10 8% All ten why statements included, well-executed, extra effort evident.\n60 45% All ten tools submitted, well executed, extra effort evident.\n20 15% All ten interpretation statements included, well executed, extra effort evident.\n133 100%\n\nSyllabus - Lean Sigma Black Belt34-1.docx Page 8\r'),

Late projects will not be accepted. However, students each have two free\ndays, which may be used during the quarter for any of the programming assignments.\n\n4) There are no makeup exams or quizzes except in documented and extreme emergencies.\n\n5) A course grade of incomplete is given only for reasons acceptable to the university.\n6) Plagiarism on projects will result in all involved students (student(s) who copied and\nstudent(s) who were copied from) being failed from the course. In addition, a report of\nthe incident will be reported to the university’s Judicial Affairs department, which may\nresult in being dismissed from the university. Please note that all programs will be\nchecked automatically for plagiarism.\n\nLecture and Lab Attendance\n\nAttendance and participation in the course is mandatory. Participation includes responding\nto questions in class, lab or office hours and making observations or discussing course\nmaterial in class, lab or office hours.\n\nReading and Homework\n\nYou are expected to read the assigned chapters prior to class. Not all material in the reading\nwill be covered in lecture or lab but you are still responsible for knowing it for quizzes and\nexams. Come to class prepared with any questions from the reading that you would like\naddressed.\n\nThere is no graded homework. However, make sure you are familiar with the concepts in the\nchapter summaries and comfortable with the questions and exercises at the end of each\nassigned chapter. Don’t be surprised if you see material like this on your quizzes and exams.\n\nLab and Lab Exercises\n\nRegular and frequent labs will be assigned and collected each week and, together, will\ncomprise 15% of your course grade. The three hours of scheduled lab time each week is the\nprimary time your instructor will be available for questions and assistance — make wise use\nof this resource! You are expected to work on the lab exercises during your scheduled lab\ntime plus as much additional time as necessary to complete them. The lab exercises are\ndesigned to familiarize you with some of the concepts necessary to complete your projects\nand to help you do well on quizzes and exams. You may work on your projects in lab after\ncompleting all currently assigned labs.\n\nIMPORTANT: No late labs will be accepted.\nNOTE: You may collaborate on lab certain exercises (as specified).\n\nProjects\nThere will be five projects over the quarter that, together, comprise 29% of your course\ngrade. Projects will consist of analysis, design, documentation, and program development\nand will be graded based on their functionality as well as the quality of the implementation —\n\nincluding coding style, efficiency, and documentation.\n\nIMPORTANT: No late projects will be accepted.\nCAUTION: You are required to complete your projects individually (unless clearly\nspecified in the assignment!). You may discuss general concepts with others inside and\noutside of class, including tutors, but you must do the specific work on the projects on your\nown. Do not even look at another student’s project code or allow another student to see\nyours. Any project, in whole or part, which is suspected of being the work of more than one\nstudent, will be considered plagiarism. Projects will be compared using software that can\nreliably detect similarities among programs. See the Policies and Advisories section above\nregarding the penalties for plagiarism.\n\nQuizzes and Exams\n\nThere will be several separate lecture and lab quizzes, and one common lecture final. The\nfinal exam will be cumulative and comprehensive and will cover material covered in lecture,\nyour text, as well as programming skills of analysis, design, and implementation used in your\nlabs and projects. Lab quizzes will focus on programming skills and knowledge acquired\nprimarily, though not exclusively, from labs and projects.\n\nThe lecture quizzes are intended to measure your understanding of the course material. If you\nscore below 75% on the first lecture quiz, then you will be required to attend 105 meetings or\ntutoring sessions to prepare for a makeup quiz. Scoring higher on the makeup quiz than on\nthe original quiz will improve your recorded quiz score (to a maximum of 75%).\n\nThe programming quizzes are used to check minimum programming proficiency. Each quiz\nmust be an individual effort without input from your classmates or any other external\nsources. These will be administered in lab, but you will be able to practice prior to the quiz\ndate. You must demonstrate minimal proficiency on these programming quizzes in order to\neam a course grade better than a D+.\n\nNOTE (Unless otherwise specified):\nThe lecture quizzes, midterm, and final are closed-note and closed-book.\nLab quizzes are closed-note, closed-source, closed-web, and closed-book (unless\notherwise noted).\n\nGrading\n\nThe following table presents the percentage value of all graded items based on a course total\nof 100%:\n\n \n\nGraded Item Each Total Length (Each)\nParticipation N/A 3% N/A\n\nFive projects 5-6% 26% N/A\n\nEight weekly labs 2% 16% N/A\n\nThree lab quizzes 5% 15% ~50 minutes\nThree lecture quizzes 5% 15% 15-50 minutes\n\nOne lecture final N/A 25% 170 minutes (Cumulative)\nHonesty\n\nThe following honor statement is expected to be valid for all programs, quizzes, exams\nand class work.

One of the talks will be based on a\nchapter from one of the Devlin texts (listed below). The content of the other talk will be chosen by\nthe student (subject to instructor approval). As a supplement to the talk, the speaker will assign\nat least 3 homework problems to the rest of the class. The assigned problems should be closely\nconnected to the material covered in the lecture. The assignment will be due the next class meeting\nand will be graded (by the speaker) and returned within one week of the speaker’s presentation.\n\nA successful presentation requires substantial research and preparation. To acquire the appropriate\nlevel of background knowledge on your topics it is strongly suggested that you consult multiple\nsources. Be aware that mathematics progresses constantly: Some of the statements made in the\ncourse textbooks are now out of date.\n\nPrior to your presentation date you must meet with me to go over the details of your presentation.\nThe homework problems that you intend to assign should be ready at this time. This appointment\nis mandatory and should be scheduled at least one week ahead of time — failure to schedule and/or\nattend this conference will result in a failing grade for the course.\n\nIn addition to the presentations, students will take a mathematics achievement exam. The results\nof this exam will be used to measure the effectiveness of the Cal Poly Mathematics Major; your\ntest score will have no bearing on your course grade. This two-hour exam will be given during the\nfinal exam period scheduled for this course.\n\nTextbooks\nYou will need both of the following texts, which are available at the campus bookstore.\n\ne K. Devlin, Mathematics, the New Golden Age\n\ne K. Devlin, The Millenium Problems: the Seven Greatest Unsolved Mathematical Problems of\nOur Time\n\nGrading\n\nThe quality of your presentations is the major factor used in determining your grade (precise\nguidelines will be provided): Each presentation will contribute 40% to your course grade. Your\nhomework grade will contribute the remaining 20%. Attendance will also be considered: the first\ntwo absences are penalty-free; each absence above this limit will result in a 10% reduction in your\ncourse grade (the final exam period counts as three class meetings).\r'),

This course challenges you to\nthink critically about how elements of global marketing will affect marketing efforts. During the\nquarter, you will learn about the key environmental forces shaping consumer needs and\npreferences, the impact of foreign political and economic factors on companies, the influence of\ninternational competition, market segmentation and strategy decisions specific to international\nmarketing.\n\n_ To acquire the basic knowledge, concepts, tools, and international terminology necessary to\nunderstand international problems and issues\n\n_ To understand how companies adjust their international marketing strategies based on the\nglobal environmental changes (e.g., globalization)\n\n_ To build skills and respect toward the understanding of cultures of nations by critically\nanalyzing the social, political, legal, and economic forces that affect the business performance of\ninternational marketing\n\n_To develop managerial reading skills with a goal of acquiring the ability to understand and\nsynthesize readings and business cases presented in a class\n\n_ To build communication and teamwork skills through the group project\n\n_ To familiarize students with extant “tools” of international marketing beyond the textbook\nsuch as the Internet, government databases, etc.\n\nThe teaching method of this course is based upon cases that will force us to get to the root of the\nissues quickly and with focus. The cases are group assignments and should be presented in\nPowerPoint. That does not mean you do not conduct a complete analysis, it means you need to\nbe succinct in your presentations. Prior to beginning to work on the cases, you should\nthoroughly read the material by Ellet from The Case Study Handbook that I have posted on\nBlackboard, as this outlines how I want you to approach these \"decision\" oriented cases. You\nshould discuss these with your team as well, because much of your success in this course will\ncome from how you apply your analysis to cases.\n\nFor those of you accustomed to just \"one right answer\" to marketing questions, this course will\nforce you out of that box. In most cases, there are choices not only about what strategies to use in\nthe analysis, but also how to execute the marketing plans. Also, you will have to make\nsignificant assumptions in order to work on these cases; my expectation is that you will justify\nthese assumptions based upon the reading or the case facts.\n\nPlease think hard about case preparation; it is not just an exercise in reading and memorizing.\nThere are some suggestions in the Ellet material to help you with this. Pay special attention to\npages 10-17 in the reading entitled \"How to Analyze a Case.\" Multiple readings are essential,\nfollowed by a structured discussion with your team. We will talk about this in class, but I point\nthis out because your success in this course will be dependent on how hard, and effectively, you\nwork on the cases.\n\nThere will also be lecture notes and assignments posted on PolyLearn\n\nCOURSE LEARNING GOALS AND OBJECTIVES\n\nSpecific Learning objectives:\n\nStudents will be able to:\n\nLOI: Acquire information about international markets and use it to (a) describe customers, (b)\nunderstand markets,\n\nand (c) make marketing mix decisions\n\nLO2: Present and defend international marketing recommendations, using marketing\nterminology\n\nLO3: Illustrate an understanding of business activities in a global environment. (BSBA LO 3.2)\nLO4: Demonstrate effective written skills\n\nLOS: Demonstrate effective participation in teams\n\nThis will generally be divided into sections on the following:\n\ne Scope of International marketing\n\no Start-ups\n\no New ventures\n\no Changing Face of U.S. Business\n\no Progression of Becoming a Global Marketer\ne Dynamic Environment of International Trade\n\no GATT\no NAFTA\no WTO\n\no IMF\no Currency Fluctuation\ne History and Geography as Influences on Global Marketing\no Affect of History on Country’s Culture\no Effect of Geographic Diversity on Marketing\ne Cultural Dynamics in Assessing Global Markets\no Importance of Culture in Global Markets\n\ne Global Management and Marketing Options\ne Forecasting sales for International Ventures\ne Logistics of International Business and Marketing\ne Trade and Marketing Barriers\nGRADING\n\nGrading is based on exams from the lectures and the assignments. Grading for the class will be\nbased on 100 points (all grades are rounded up, so a 89.51 will be a 90) where:\n\n=975 A+ 40\n= 92.5 A >37\n= 90.0 A- >33\n= 875 B+ >3.0\n= 825 B >27\n= 80.0 B- >23\n2775 C+ >2.0\n=725 Cc >17\n= 70.0 C- >13\n> 675 D+ >10\n= 62.5 D >07\n= 60.0 D- >0.0\n< 60.0 E 0.0\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nGroup Grades:\n\nYour case assignments and group projects depend on group grades. Peer reviews have a direct\nimpact on the individual grade. If there is an issue about a member’s performance, bring that\nto my attention immediately. Do not wait until the last week of class! All group members are\nexpected to communicate with each other about a project throughout the quarter. If class is\nmissed for any reason, it is the responsibility of the student that missed class to learn about all\nassignments and changes in assignments from the group. All group members must participate in\nthe statistical analysis and presentation preparation. There is no excuse for miscommunication.\nEvery student can be reached through email in Blackboard. Members must work collegially,\nrespectfully, and professionally with group members. If a group member misses an\nassignment or does not contribute, a zero grade will be given. The remaining group members are\nexpected to complete the project if they do not receive the help of a group member,\nAny questions about grading and answers on exams should be presented to the instructor\n\nin writing during office hours, not during class time or before or after class in the\nclassroom.\n\n \n\nCLASS MEETING TIME:\n\nThis class will convene at all class times throughout the quarter, unless instructor\nindicates otherwise.\n\nIt is important for the student to take notes during lectures, student presentations, and\ndiscuss questions with the instructor during class or during office hours. Information\nprovided in the lectures is essential for the student to successfully complete the course.\n\nStudents are responsible for all material in the assigned readings and all material\npresented by the professor, professional speakers, and other students in group\nprojects. All material discussed in class and research are topics for exams.\n\nPARTICIPATION:\n\nAll students are expected to attend every class session and responsibly participate in class and team\nmeetings.\n\nPlease bring a “ nameplate” with you to class so your classmates and I may more easily learn your name.\n\nIt is important that you arrive on time and do not leave early, as late entrances and early exits are disruptive\nand inappropriate.\n\nPlease turn off or set on inaudible all electronic devices.\n\nIf you have a verifiable university-sanctioned reason for missing an assignment, such as illness, death, field trip,\nmilitary obligation, or religious holiday, please speak with me in advance or as soon as possible.

However,\nthere is an O’Reiley book for each component of our class. The books below\nare all recommended reading.\n\ne Donald Miner, Adam Shook, MapReduce Design Pattern: Building Effec-\ntive Algorithms and Analytics for Hadoop and Other Systems, O’Reiley\nMedia, Ist Edition, 2012, ISBN: 978-1449327170.\ne Mahmoud Parsian, Data Algorithms: Recipes for Scaling Up With Hadoop\nand Spark, O’Reiley Media, 2015, ISBN: 978-1491906187.\n\ne Christina Chodorow, MongoDB: The Definitive Guide, O’Reiley Media,\n2013, ISBN: 978-144924468\n\ne Holden Karau, Andy Konwinski, Patrick Wendell, Matei Zaharia, Learn-\ning Spark: Lightining-Fast Big Data Analysis, Packt, 2015, ISBN: 978-\n1449358624\n\ne Tomasz Drabas, Denny Lee, Learning PySpark, O’Reiley Media, 2017,\nISBN-13: 978-1786463708\nTopics\n\nThe following will be covered in the course.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nNo. | Topic Duration\n(weeks)\n\n1.

Because of this,\nthe traditional 90-A, 80-B, 70-C grading schema does not work in my classes.\nHistorically, the A/B cutoff has been around 80-85%, while the B/C cutoff has\nbeen around 67-70%.\n\nCourse Policies\n\nExams\n\nThere will be two midterms and no final exam in this course (I may be away\nfrom the country during the finals week).\n\nThe midterms will probably take place on one of the following days: February\n11 (Monday) or February 13 (Wednesday), and March 15, (Friday).\n\nMake-up exams will not be given, unless there are extraordinary circum-\nstances present and I am notified in advance. The policy regarding the use of\ntextbooks and notes will be announced at least one week prior to each exam.\nHomeworks, Labs\n\nThe course will have 6-8 lab assignments, designed to let you test in practice\nwhat we have learned in class. Each lab assignment will span multiple lab\nssions (typically 2 or 3). Due dates/times will be explicitly provided for each\nsignment. Typically, the assignments are due midnight of the day of the last\nlab period. Often a new lab assignment will already have been specified by\nthen. You are welcome to work on the lab assignments outside the lab hours,\nhowever, lab period attendance is highly encouraged.\n\nSome assignments will be individual. Other will be small team or pair pro-\ngramming assignments. Groups/pairings are to be formed by you - I will only\nintervene if someone cannot find a group/pair, or if there is a hard-to-resolve is-\nsue that requires my attention. You are welcome to stay in the same group/pair\nfor multiple lab assignments, or form a new group/pair for each non-individual\nassignment. All members of a group will recieve the same grade for the assign-\nment.\n\nIn addition to labs, a number of paper-and-pencil homeworks will be as-\nsigned. Homeworks are my way of providing you with some exam study guides.\nHomeworks will be collected, but will not, as a rule, be graded.\n\n  \n\n \n \n\n \n\nLate Submissions\n\nAll assignments are due at classtime on the due date: homeworks - at the\nbeginning of the class (with grace period extending to the beginning of the lab\nperiod); lab assignments - at the end of the lab period. Any deviations from\nthese rules will be spelled out explicitly in the assignments.\n\nHomework/lab assignments submitted later than indicated above will be\nconsidered late submissions.\n\nIf paper-and-pencil homework solutions are distributed on the due date of\nthe homework, late homework submissions will not be accepted. Oth-\nerwise, late homeworks can be submitted during next 24 hours for a 10-30%\npenalty (the exact amount will depend on the submission time and the specific\ncircumstances). No homework submissions will be accepted afterwards.\n\nLate lab assignment submissions can be turned in before or at the beginning\nof the next lab period for a 10-30% penalty (the exact amount will depend\non the submission time and the specific circumstances\'). No lab assignment\nsubmissions will be accepted after that.\n\nCommunication\nThe class has an official mailing list:\ncsc-369-01-2192@calpoly.edu\n\n1 The penalty will be larger if the gap between the two lab periods includes a weekend and\nsmaller otherwise\nAll students enrolled in the class are automatically subscribed to the mailing\nlist.\n\nI encourage questions during time and questions via email. My answers\nto email questions may be broadcast to the entire class via the mailing list, if the\nanswer may be relevant to everyone (e.g. a correction in a text of a handout,\nor a clarification of a homework problem), and may also appear on the web\npage. The questions can also be posted to the mailing list directly. The mailing\nlist will also be used for all annoucements related to the course. It is your\nresponsibility to read your class-related email. Failure to read email posted to\nmailing list cannot be used as an excuse in the class.\n\n \n\nWeb Page\nClass web page can be found at\n\nhttp: //www.csc.calpoly.edu/~dekhtyar/369-Winter2019\n\n \n \n \n\nThrough this page you will be able to ac\nhomeworks, project information and lecture notes\n\nall class handouts including\nshould the latter be written).\n\nAcademic Integrity\n\nUniversity Policies\n\nCal Poly’s Academic Integrity policies are found at\nhttp: //www.academicprograms.calpoly.edu/academicpolicies/Cheating.htm\nIn particular, these policies define cheating as (684.1)\n\n“... obtaining or attempting to obtain, or aiding another to obtain\ncredit for work, or any improvement in evaluation of performance, by\nany dishonest or deceptive means. Cheating includes, but is not lim-\nited to: lying; copying from another’s test or examination; discussion\nof answers or questions on an examination or test, unless such dis\nsion is specifically authorized by the instructor; taking or receiving\ncopies of an exam without the permission of the instructor; using or\ndisplaying notes, ”cheat sheets,” or other information devices inap-\npropriate to the prescribed test conditions; allowing someone other\nthan the officially enrolled student to represent same.”\n\n \n\nS-\n\nPlagiarism, per University policies is defined as (684.3)\n\n“... the act of using the ideas or work of another person or persons\nas if they were one’s own without giving proper credit to the source.\nSuch an act is not plagiarism if it is ascertained that the ideas were\narrived through independent reasoning or logic or where the thought\nor idea is common knowledge. Acknowledgement of an original au-\nthor or source must be made through appropriate references; i.e.,\nquotation marks, footnotes, or commentary.”\nUniversity policies state (684.2): “Cheating requires an “F” course grade and\nfurther attendance in the course is prohibited.” (appeal process is also outlined,\nsee the web site above for details.). Plagiarism, per university policies (684.4)\ncan be treated as a form of cheating, although a level of discretion is given to\nthe instructor, allowing the instuctor to determine the causes of plagiarism and\neffect other means of remedy. It is the obligation of the instructor to inform the\nstudent that a penalty is being assessed in such cases.\n\n \n\nCourse Policies\n\nAll homeworks are to be completed by each student individually. Lab assign-\nments are to be completed by the appropriate units (individual, pair, group),\nand no code/solution-sharing between units is permitted. Students are encour-\naged to discuss class content among themselves but NOT in a manner that con-\nstitutes plagiarism and cheating as defined above (e.g., you can solve together\na problem from the textbook that had not been assigned in the homework, but\nyou should solve assigned problems individually).\n\not\r'),

You are encouraged to ask questions when you have them.\nUse lecture time to discuss general approaches to the project. Use lab time to ask questions of me, work\nwith your partner on implementation specific issues, and test.\n\nEquipment\n\nWe will be generating ARM assembly to be run on Raspberry Pis in this class. There are several Raspberry\nPis available for you to use remotely via SSH. These systems will allow you to use your CSL account and\nhome directory. Login information will be provided in the first lab assignment. You may also use your own\nPi if you have one. A recommended configuration is provided on the course website.\n\nPaper\n\nEach group will submit a paper detailing the design and implementation of their compiler project. At least\nhalf of the grade for the paper will depend on the presentation of some performance analysis of the code\ngenerated by the group’s compiler. This paper must\n\nOutline the overall architecture of the solution.\n\nOutline the representation of key data (e.g., control flow graphs and instructions).\n\nOutline optimizations implemented.\n\nProvide a section detailing the performance of the code generated for the benchmarks. This section\nmust contain graphs comparing the run-times of the generated code (with and without optimizations)\nand the comparison of the code compiled using GCC (with equivalent optimization levels).\n\ne Be formatted in IEEE conference format, submitted as PDF. See https: //www.ieee.org/conferences/\n\npublishing/templates.html\n\nA rubric will be provided for you.\n\nGrading\n\nEach milestone will be demonstrated in lecture/lab on the day that it is due. Milestones will be graded\nbased on a somewhat subjective measure of how “complete” the required functionality is. This subjectivity\nis based on your software design methodology, the complexity of the algorithms you choose to implement,\nand your test coverage.\n\nWeighting\n\nThese weights will be subject to change based on how the class as a whole is able to progress through the\nproject.\n\n2 of [4]\nCPE 431 Compilers Fall 2019\n\n \n\n20% — Milestones Your scores will be evaluated on processing test case inputs correctly.\n\n30% — Final Submission This submission must include all of your source code, instructions on how to\nbuild your project, and instructions on using your compiler in the form of a detailed README.\n\n20% — Paper\n\n30% — Quizzes There will be approximately four (4) quizzes during the quarter to assess your under-\nstanding of code-generation concepts.\n\nGrade curving, if any, will be based on the overall course outcomes.\n\nLateness\n\n50% off for first day late. No credit after 1 day late. (Weekends count as 1 day).\n\nElectronic Resources\n\nCampuswire\n\nWe will be using Campuswire for class discussion. The system is highly catered to getting you help fast\nand efficiently from classmates, the TA, and myself. Rather than emailing questions to me, I encourage\nyou to post your questions on Campuswire.\n\nFind our Campuswireclass page at:\nThe class code will be sent to those enrolled via email.\n\nAll class material will be posted either on the course website or via Campuswire. You are strongly\nencouraged to check these websites often, as all assignments, study guides, and important dates will be\nposted on them.\n\nGitHub\n\nYour project will be submitted via GitHub. If you have never used git before, you should create an account\nand familiarize yourself with basic commands.\n\nCourse Policies\n\nDiversity, Equity, and Inclusivity\n\nIt is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well served by this course,\nand that students’ learning needs be addressed both in and out of class. I feel that the diversity that\nstudents bring to this class is a resource, strength and benefit. It is my intent to present materials and\nactivities that are respectful of your gender, sexual identity, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity,\nrace, and culture. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to improve\nthe effectiveness of the course for you personally, or for other students or student groups.\n\nClassroom Civility\n\nYou are expected to behave professionally and respectfully to both your classmates and the instructor.\nPersons being disruptive will be asked to leave.\n\n3 of [4]\nCPE 431 Compilers Fall 2019\n\n \n\nRight to Change Syllabus\n\nT reserve the right to make any changes to this syllabus at any time during the course. If I do make changes,\nyou will be notified, and the changes will be posted.\n\nCheating\n\nCheating or any other form of academic dishonesty will not be tolerated in this course. Students caught\ncheating will be referred to Student Affairs, and will have the maximum penalty imposed. You are respon-\nsible for making yourself aware of Cal Poly’s cheating policy, which can be found at:\n\nhttp://academicprograms.calpoly.edu/academicpolicies/Cheating.htm\n\nStudents with Learning and/or Physical Disabilities\n\nAny student with a learning and/or physical disability who needs accommodations or assistance in this\ncourse should meet with me as soon as possible.\n\nElectronic Devices\n\nElectronic devices (e.g., phones, laptops, tablets, smart watches, smart glasses etc.) are prohibited during\nlectures unless explicit permission is given. Research shows that your grades will be better without these\ndevices in class! See tp: //uww. ¢s¢. calpoly .edu/~clupo/ papers/Laptops~in-col lege=classroons\nfor the research.\n\nYou may, however, use the devices in lab.

The course is intended for senior students in Computer Science,\nSoftware Engineering and Computer Engineering majors, as well as for students\ncompleting the Cross-Disciplinary Studies Minor in Data Science. The course\ngives a broad overview of data mining (association rules mining, classification,\nclustering), information filtering and recommender systems, information retrieval\nand web search, and web mining.\nLearning Objectives\n\nAfter taking the course the students are expected to be able to\n1. recognize different types of KDD procedures and identify their uses;\n\n2. implement algorithms/methods/techniques for KDD tasks to solve KDD\nproblems;\n\n3. interpret and analyze the results of KDD processes;\n\n4, recognize and evaluate societal impact of KDD technology, make in-\nformed choices about use of KDD technology.\n\nTexbook\n\ne Bing Liu.

Advanced Topics 1\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nPlease note that the order in which these topics are covered may be different\nthan the order in which they are presented above.\nGrading\n\nLabs and Homeworks 60%\nLab Exam 10%\nProjects 30%\n\nCourse Policies\n\nPrerequisites\n\nThe official prerequistite for this course is CSC 349 (Algorithms). This prereq-\nuisite is enforced strictly. CSC 466 can be viewed as an advanced algorithms\ncourse for a certain important category of algorithms. Therefore, it is important\nthat the craft of algorithm design is not a mystery to anyone in the class.\n\nExams\n\nThe course will have no written exams. In their stead you will be offered\nthree things:\n\n1. A take-home group project. The project assignment will come out after\nWeek 5-6 of the class, once the finish covering the core topics of the course\n(classification and clustering). The group assignment will ask you to apply\nthe methods studied in the course to exploratory analysis of some real-life\ndata.\n\n2. A take-home individual assignment. This assignment will come out in the\nlast 2-3 weeks of the class, and will most likely be a creative writing\nexercise.\n\n3. An in-class lab exam. The lab exam will most likely take place during the\nlab periods of Week 10 of the course. You will be asked to write some code\nto implement some straightforward KDD tasks. We will be using Jupyter\nNotebooks for the exam, and you will be given some sample problems at\nleast a week or two ahead of the time.\n\nMost of lab assignments and other coursework in this course is done in\neither small teams or in pairs. The individual assignment and the lab exam\nwere introduced into the class to allow me to properly assess individual abilities\nof students, that otherwise may have been obscured due to teamwork.\n\nThe reserved final examination time will be used for group project presen-\ntations.\n\nLabs, Homeworks\n\nHands-on KDD-related activities are the core part of the course. Some activities\nwill be set up as lab exercises, some other activities may be offered as purely\ntake-home assignments (this will be determined by the pace of the course).\nEach lab/homework assignment will involve some data analysis task, that\nmay involve using existing software, software provided by the instructor as well\nas (and mostly) the software developed by you. The course concentrates on ba-\nsic algorithms for performing standard KDD tasks: the labs/assignments\ngive you an opportunity to cement the knoweldge of the algorithms covered in\nclass.\n\nMost of the lab assignments are pair programming assignmnets, although\nsome exceptions may be made either in favor of small teams, or in favor of\nindividual assignments. This will be announced ahead of each lab assignment.\n\nNote: Machine learning, data mining and other KDD algorithms that we\nare going to study in the class are widely available, both as open source code\nand, in some cases, as methods/functions in popular KDD libraries. One of the\ngoals of this course is to have you implement these algorithms from\nscratch! The assignments will specify when you can, and when you cannot\nthird-party code/libraries to achieve the goals of the assignment.\n\nNote 2: At the same time, in a lot of the assignments, the main deliverable\nwill be not the code you write, but rather, the insight you obtain by running\nyour code on the data provided to you. Please be aware of that, as this shift in\nwhat is the main deliverable, is perhaps one of the key unique features of CSC\n466.\n\nLate Submissions\n\nLate lab and assignment submissions are strongly discouraged. The course\nwill run on a tight schedule, and not submitting on time will lead to time\ncarved out of the next assignment. A penalty of 10 - 30% will be assessed for\nany submissions that are late by less than 24 hours. No credit will be given\nfor any later submissions. You are encouraged to submit on time even if your\nsubmission it is not perfect. You can then resubmit a fixed version late, subject\nto the abovementioned rules. When more than one submission is present, we\nwill independently grade two submissions: (i) the latest on-time submission and\n(ii) the latest late submission for which non-zero credit can be assessed. Your\ngrade for the project will be the maximum of the two grades.\n\n \n\nCommunication\n\nThe class will have an official mailing list. The email address for the mailing\nlist is csc-466-01-2198@calpoly.edu. All students enrolled in the class are auto-\nmatically subscribed to the mailing list (using the email addresss that the CS\ndepartment has on file).\n\nI encourage questions during classtime and questions via email. My answers\nto email questions may be broadcast to the entire class via the mailing list, if the\nanswer may be relevant to everyone (e.g. a correction in a text of a handout,\nor a clarification of a homework problem), and may also appear on the web\npage. The questions can also be posted to the mailing list directly. The mailing\nlist will also be used for all annoucements related to the course. It is your\nresponsibility to read your class-related email. Failure to read email posted to\nthe mailing list cannot be used as an excuse in the class.\n\n \n\nWeb Page\nClass web page can be found at\nhttp: //www.csc.calpoly.edu/~dekhtyar/466-Fall2019\n\nThrough this page you will be able to access all class handouts including\nhomeworks, lab assignments, project information, lab/project data and lecture\nnotes.\n\nLinks to additional information, and notes and announcements will also be\nposted.\n\nAcademic Integrity\n\nUniversity Policies\n\nCal Poly’s Academic Integrity policies are found at\nhttp: //www.academicprograms.calpoly.edu/academicpolicies/Cheating.htm\nIn particular, these policies define cheating as (684.1)\n\n“... obtaining or attempting to obtain, or aiding another to obtain\ncredit for work, or any improvement in evaluation of performance, by\nany dishonest or deceptive means. Cheating includes, but is not lim-\nited to: lying; copying from another’s test or examination; discussion\nof answers or questions on an examination or test, unless such discus-\nsion is specifically authorized by the instructor; taking or receiving\ncopies of an exam without the permission of the instructor; using or\ndisplaying notes, ”cheat sheets,” or other information devices inap-\npropriate to the prescribed test conditions; allowing someone other\nthan the officially enrolled student to represent same.”\n\nPlagiarism, per University policies is defined as (684.3)\n\n“... the act of using the ideas or work of another person or persons\nas if they were one’s own without giving proper credit to the source.\nSuch an act is not plagiarism if it is ascertained that the ideas were\narrived through independent reasoning or logic or where the thought\nor idea is common knowledge. Acknowledgement of an original au-\nthor or source must be made through appropriate references; i.e.,\nquotation marks, footnotes, or commentary.”\n\nUniversity policies state (684.2): “Cheating requires an “F” course grade and\nfurther attendance in the course is prohibited.” (appeal process is also outlined,\nsee the web site above for details.). Plagiarism, per university policies (684.4)\n\non\ncan be treated as a form of cheating, although a level of discretion is given to\nthe instructor, allowing the instuctor to determine the causes of plagiarism and\neffect other means of remedy. It is the obligation of the instructor to inform the\nstudent that a penalty is being assessed in such cases.\n\nCourse Policies\n\nAll homeworks are to be completed by each student individually. Lab assign-\nments are to be completed by the appropriate units (individual, pair, group),\nand no code/solution-sharing between units is permitted. Students are encour-\naged to discuss class content among themselves but NOT in a manner that con-\nstitutes plagiarism and cheating as defined above (e.g., you can solve together\na problem from the textbook that had not been assigned in the homework, but\nyou should solve assigned problems individually).\r'),

Handouts from previous lectures will be available on the course web pages.\n\nStatistical Packages: We will be predominantly using the R software package for data analysis and\nexploration. You will be given instructions for how to use Minitab 17, JMP 12.2, R/RStudio, and\nMicrosoft Word as needed for this course. All of these packages are freely available (see course\nwebpage for downloading instructions) and are available in the Library Learning Commons. You are\nfree to use other packages, I just may not be able to help you. You are also required to bring a scientific\ncalculator with you to each class session.\n\nOwnership of course materials: The course materials provided to you online and in class are yours for\nyour personal use for the quarter and to keep as a reference for your career. I expressly do not give\npermission for you to sell or freely distribute my course materials, including exams, quizzes, homework\nassignments, or solutions.\nSpring, 2017\n\nClass Participation: You are expected to participate fully in class discussions. There will also be\nnumerous “discussion questions” assigned as well as examples that you complete in class or between\nclasses and submit your answers in the Practice Problems discussion board. These (about 20-25) will be\ngraded, but predominantly in terms of “was seriously attempted” vs. “was not really attempted.” You\nneed to be prepared to discuss your analysis to a particular problem to the rest of the class. If you work\ntogether, include both students’ names.\n\nTerm Project: There will be a data collection project due in several stages during the quarter in which\nyou will be asked to work in groups of 2-3 to apply the methods we learn this quarter and to produce\nword processed or RMarkdown reports of your analyses. (Stat 524 students will work individually and\nwill be more responsible for presentations.) Details will appear on the course web pages.\n\nHomeworks: You are encouraged to work together on assignments but you must write up your solutions\nindividually and hand in your own work. If I determine assignments are too similar, I will divide the\ngrade among the individuals. You are also encouraged/expected to ask questions during and outside of\nclass. You are expected to utilize the computer for much of your analysis and must include all relevant\noutput with your assignment for full credit. Graded assignments will be returned in class or can be\npicked up from me. Late homeworks will NOT be accepted, but I will review previous assignments\nwith you if you complete them after the deadline. Your lowest homework score will automatically be\ndropped. You are advised to not use this up too early in the quarter and to start your assignment early in\nthe week. After the due date, homework solutions will be posted on the webpages.\n\nThe main requirement for all problems is that you EXPLAIN your answers. Often, questions may\nhave more than one correct answer so several answers will be accepted as long as they are JUSTIFIED.\nYou should also state any ASSUMPTIONS that you make. Soon you will be explaining your results to\nmanagers and people outside your discipline, so you need to get used to explaining and backing up the\nnumbers in English! You’ll also be given partial credit for your work, so it is important to at least\nattempt each problem.\n\nGrading: Class Participation/Practice: 5% Homeworks: 20%\nMidterms: 40% (15%, 25% each)\nTerm Project (3 parts): 25% (7.5%, 12.5%, 15%)\n\nExams: There will be two in class exams (4/27 and 5/25). Graded exams will be returned in class or can\nbe picked up from me.\nMake-up Policy: Make-up oral exams will be given to students who notify me (with appropriate\nproof) at least two days before the exam of their unavoidable absence.\n\nClassroom Culture: The textbook will serve as a guide but I expect to supplement the material in the\ntextbook extensively. It will be important for you to come to class, to participate fully, to ask questions,\nand to be responsible for all course handouts. This will allow us to focus more on the interpretation and\npresentation of statistical analyses. I cannot overemphasize the importance for you to follow along with\nthe reading assignments and to ask questions of me for any components that are not clear. I hope to\ncreate a collaborative learning environment, where you feel comfortable asking questions and working\ntogether. Still, I do ask that when I am lecturing that you give me your complete and undivided (or at\nleast silent) attention and that you are respectful of me and your classmates. This includes turning off all\ncell phones during class. If you must use your cell phone, please leave the room.\nSpring, 2017\n\nFOR BETTER OR FOR WORSE\r'),

The policy regarding the use of\ntextbooks and notes will be announced at least one week prior to each exam.\n\nHomeworks, Labs\n\nThe course will have 6-8 lab assignments, designed to\n\net you test in practice\n\nwhat we have learned in class. Each lab assignment will span multiple lab\nsessions (typically 2 or 3). Each lab assignment is due by the end of lab period\non the due date (unless specified otherwise). You are welcome to work on\n\nthe lab assignments outside the lab hours, however, la\n\nperiod attendance is\n\nmandatory. You may only leave the lab period (a) with the express permission of\n\nthe instructor if (b) the current assignment is complete a’\n\nnd the next assignment\n\nhas not been made available yet. Some lab assignments can be done in pairs or\n\ngroups of three, while others will be individual.

You are welcome to stay in the same grow\n\np/pair for multiple lab\n\nassignments, or form a new group/pair for each non-individual assignment. All\n\nmembers of a group will recieve the same grade for the assignment.\n\nIn addition to labs, a number of paper-and-pencil\n\nhomeworks will be as-\n\nsigned. Homeworks will typically consist of problems taken from database text-\n\nbooks, or similarly styled problems.\nLate Submissions\n\nAll assignments are due at classtime on the due date: homeworks - at the\nbeginning of the class (with grace period extending to the beginning of the lab\nperiod); lab assignments - at the end of the lab period. Any deviations from\nthese rules will be spelled out explicitly in the assignments.\n\nHomework/lab assignments submitted later than indicated above will be\nconsidered late submissions.\n\nIf paper-and-pencil homework solutions are distributed on the due date of\nthe homework, late homework submissions will not be accepted.

All students enrolled in the class are\nautomatically subscribed to the mailing list.\n\nI encourage questions during classtime and questions via email. My answers\nto email questions may be broadcast to the entire class via the mailing list, if the\nanswer may be relevant to everyone (e.g. a correction in a text of a handout,\nor a clarification of a homework problem), and may also appear on the web\npage. The questions can also be posted to the mailing list directly. The mailing\nlist will also be used for all annoucements related to the course.

Each week one member of the\ngroup is to submit the “group” report. Throughout the quarter, group members are expected to\nrotate the duties of writing the group lab report so that every student has submitted at least two\ngroup reports.\n\nThe report should contain the following sections:\n\n1. Title\n\n2. Names of all group members. The name of the student who is writing the group lab report\nshould be circled.\n\n3. Abstract: Leave a few lines blank and fill this section in at the end when you know what you\ndid. In the abstract state the aim(s) of the experiment, briefly describe the experiment, and\nstate your results. In every experiment we test a physics equation or “model” to see if it\naccurately describes experimental measurements. Your abstract should state what this\nphysics model is, and if the model quantitatively predicted your experiment well.\n\n4. Data, Analysis and Error: Tables for data, plots, and any calculations that you performed in\nthe process of doing the lab procedure. Organize your work neatly as you go. Include labels\nand explanatory sentences to explain your thought processes. If you plot things on the\ncomputer, print the plots and label them e.g. “Figure 1 Pendulum Data” and then refer to\nFigure 1 in your report. You won’t get full credit unless you show your work for all\ncalculations. Each data measurement should include an estimate of the uncertainty in the\nform + 1 mm. If there is difficulty determining the measurement uncertainty, such as the\ntiming of clicking a stop watch, include this in your estimate of the uncertainty.\n\n5. Summary Table of Results: List the main results of the measurements and the percent\ndifference from what you expected.\n\n6. Questions: Answer the follow-up questions using complete sentences. If the answer to one\nof the questions seems like it is redundant, just make sure that the result is in your summary\ntable.\n\n7. Conclusions: Wrap it up with the conclusions you can make about the physical world\nbecause of what you did. Did the physics model describe the experiment well? List the\nsources of error that the physics model did not include (e.g. friction, air resistance, etc.). You\nshould also comment on ways to improve your experimental results. (Never use the words\n“human error.” Instead say something specific like “the accuracy of our length\nmeasurements was limited by our ability to determine the location of the center of mass of\nthe weight.”)\n\nBefore you disassemble your experiment and delete the data on the lab computer, please let me\ncheck your report for obvious mistakes. This will help me help you get a better grade.\n\nGrading: Lab report plus lab recitation grades will be graded on a scale of 0 to 10.\nYour grade in this lab depends equally on the scores from the reports that you write and the\nscores of the reports that your lab partners write.

CSC 369 will be\ntaught in a synchronous distance mode. This means:\n\ne We will have live lectures scheduled during the lecture part of the course\nand delivered via Zoom with Slack support.\n\ne The lectures will be recorded for the benefit of the students who are unable\nto join live lectures, and will be made available to everyone.\nLab periods will be used for structured activities or for work on weekly\nlab assignments and will take place over Zoom with Slack support.\n\nOffice hours are all via Zoom with Slack support. Email also works.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nAs everyone else, I had to figure out how to shift this course into a distance\nmode on a very short notice, and with limited resources. This may backfire.\nI reserve the right to change the mode of operation if the initial attempts at\nteaching the course prove ineffective.\n\nTexbook\n\nThe course does not have a required textbook, primarily because no book\nknown to the intructor has exactly the content covered in this course. However,\nthere is an O’Reiley book for each component of our class. The books below\nare all recommended reading.\n\nDonald Miner, Adam Shook, MapReduce Design Pattern: Building Effec-\ntive Algorithms and Analytics for Hadoop and Other Systems, O’Reiley\nMedia, 1st Edition, 2012, ISBN: 978-1449327170.\n\nMahmoud Parsian, Data Algorithms: Recipes for Scaling Up With Hadoop\nand Spark, O’Reiley Media, 2015, ISBN: 978-1491906187.\n\nChristina Chodorow, MongoDB: The Definitive Guide, O’Reiley Media,\n2013, ISBN: 978-144924468\n\nHolden Karau, Andy Konwinski, Patrick Wendell, Matei Zaharia, Learn-\ning Spark: Lightining-Fast Big Data Analysis, Packt, 2015, ISBN: 978-\n1449358624\n\nTomasz Drabas, Denny Lee, Learning PySpark, O’Reiley Media, 2017,\nISBN-13: 978-1786463708\n\nTopics\n\nThe following will be covered in the course.\n\n \n\nNo. | Topic Duration\n(weeks)\nIntroduction: Distributed Systems and Computations\nKey-Value Relationships / MongoDB\n\nMapReduce/ Hadoop\n\n \n\nResilient Distributed Datasets and Spark\n\n \n\nMost of the topics will be covered in the order specified above, but some\nvariations are possible during the course.\nGrading\n\nHomeworks 0-5%\nLabs 50 - 60%\nExams/Written Assessments 35 — 50%\n\nThis quarter, the most difficult part is to figure out how to evaluate your\nwork. The Lab assignments (see below) will remain roughly the same as before,\nrearranged to largely be for individual, rather than pair programming work.\n\nThe exams, though, will require a reassessment. I am lowering their impact\non the class. The format of the exams will also change. More on this below.\n\n \n\nCourse Policies\n\nExams\n\nThe in-person version of the course traditionally had two paper-and-pencil ex-\nams: either two midterms, or one midterm and one final exam.\n\nThe exact exams that were administered in previous versions of this course\nare infeasible in a distance environment, the questions assumed closed-book,\nclosed-notes format, which cannot be assumedd when running exams in a dis-\ntance mode.\n\nIn this course we will have three ” written assessments/exams” - one per each\nof the key topics we are studying: distributed DBMS, MapReduce, Resilient\nDistributed Datasets. At the moment, it looks like all three assessments will be\ndone in a form of a lab exam - offered during the scheduled class time (lecture\nand/or lab period).\n\nAdditionally, we may have 3-4 short ”paper-and-pencil” (more like Google\nForms) quizzes, and a final exam that consits of both a paper-and-pencil and\na programming part. (Alternatively, our third assessment can be moved to the\nfinals week to give us more time in class).\n\n  \n\nHomeworks, Labs\n\nThe course will have 6-8 lab assignments, designed to let you test in practice\nwhat we have learned in class. Each lab assignment will span multiple lab\nssions (typically 2 or 3). Due dates/times will be explicitly provided for each\nassignment. You are welcome to work on the lab assignments outside the lab\nhours, however, lab period attendance may be helpful as I will be there to answer\nquestions.\n\nMost labs will be individual. Some time in the middle of the quarter we may\ntry pair programming assignments. If they work well, we may continue pair\nprogramming labs for the rest of the quarter - as most of my assignments from\nprior quarters are pair programming assignments.\n\nIn a typical course, I use paper-and-pencil homeworks as exam study guides.\nThis may or may not be appropriate for this course, depending on the exact\nnature of written assessments. Still, paper-and-pencil homeworks may be as-\nsigned - primarily to make sure you have seen the types of problems that might\npop up on the quizzes and paper-and-pencil exam portions. I usually collect\nhomeworks, but do not grade them - the grades are given for completion.\n\nLate Submissions\n\nDue to the nature of the course, I will try to be flexible with the due dates.\nHowever, please understand the following:\n\ne When selecting the initial due dates, I already am trying to be as per-\nmissive as possible about the time to complete the assignment.\n\ne I typically have a grace period of anywhere from two to twelve hours past\nthe submission deadline during which any late submissions are not really\nconsidered late.\n\ne If you need an extension, please talk to me before the deadline passes,\nnot after.\n\ne Deadlines are there ensure that you can switch from work on one assign-\nment to working on the next. Most of the lab assignments in this class are\nindependent of each other - failing to complete one in any way disadvan-\ntages your ability to complete the next one. Therefore, if you are having\nissues with a specific lab, or if you missed a portion of a class — my advice\n\n \n\nis often cut losses and move on to the next assignment.\n\ne I do award partial credit for pretty much everything.\n\nCommunication\n\nFor this quarter, communication is especially important.\n\nMailing List\nThe class has an official mailing list:\ncsc-369-01-2204@calpoly.edu\n\nAll students enrolled in the class are automatically subscribed to the mailing\nlist.\n\nFor the first two weeks, I am also maintaining a mailing list for the waitlist.\nAll waitlisted students are receiving all communications and access to the course\nresources.\n\nMailing list is my primary means of getting information to you in between\nclasses. It may be supplanted by Slack and other means, but I am old-school,\nso in times of need I revert to tired and true solutions.\nZoom\n\nWe will be using Zoom for lectures, labs, and office hours. Thtwo Zoom confer-\nences related to this course:\n\ne The lecture/lab conference call, scheduled for MWF 12pm — 3pm. This\nconference call will also be used for Monday’s and Friday’s office hour\nin between the lecture and the lab period. This conference call requires\nregistration. Registration information has been sent to you.\n\ne The Tuesday office hours conference call. You have received the Zoom link\nto it.\n\nSlack\n\nI have created the\nhttps: / /calpolycsc369.slack.com\n\nSlack organization to help run the course. Our Slack includes channels for\ncommunication with me during lectures, lab periods, and office hours. It also\nincludes channels for discussions of each major technology covered in the course,\nas well as additional channels.\n\nYou are welcome to communicate with me and among yourselves via Slack.\nPlease keep off-topic discussions to #random and #general. You are also wel-\ncome to use private channels to contact me one-on-one.\n\nI will keep the Slack application open during lectures, office hours and labs.\n\nWeb Pages\n\nWe will have two web pages: a ”regular” static web page for most of the tradi-\ntional course content, and a Canvas page to distribute course materials (mostly\nrecordings of lectures) that I want to restrict access to.\n\nThe statis class web page can be found at\n\nhttp: //www.csc.calpoly.edu/~dekhtyar/369-Spring2020\n\nThrough this page you will be able to access all class handouts including\nhomeworks, project information and lecture notes (should the latter be written).\nThe Canvas page will be made available to you via your MyCalPoly portal.\n\n \n\nAcademic Integrity\nUniversity Policies\nCal Poly’s Academic Integrity policies are found at\nhttp: //www.academicprograms.calpoly.edu/academicpolicies/Cheating.htm\n\nIn particular, these policies define cheating as (684.1)\n\non\n“... obtaining or attempting to obtain, or aiding another to obtain\ncredit for work, or any improvement in evaluation of performance, by\nany dishonest or deceptive means.

We have to make the effort to see landscapes clearly, without bias and in their totality, and we\nmust appreciate their aesthetic qualities and grasp their identities with all the sensitivity we can\nmuster.\n\nTed Relph To See With the Soul of the Eye\n\nCourse Introduction\n\nThe natural landscape is a complex system of living organisms and inorganic materials, the\nbasis on which designs and plans are constructed. All development proposed by man, either\nplanned or unplanned, will create varying degrees of impact on the natural system, causing its\noriginal character to change.\n\nMany of the ecologically and aesthetically unsound changes perpetrated on the landscape\nthrough time have occurred because of a failure to either consider or understand natural and\ncultural factors. A designer\'s major objective in the design process is to see that both the\necological and cultural impacts of man\'s development are minimized, while optimizing human\nuse and enjoyment of the landscape. As students, you must learn to develop an analytical\napproach that thoroughly investigates the landscape as both a natural and cultural system.\n\nIn summary, we are seeking a process capable of generating a sense of \"fit\" between man\'s\nactivity, the environment, and a landscape\'s character. A process need not, however, be a\nstandardized, routine, inflexible approach. You will, of necessity, modify it to fit yourself and\nvarious circumstances you encounter.\n\n \n\n \n\nCourse Objectives\n\nUpon successful completion of this course, you should have developed:\n\n. an empathy for and knowledge of the natural and cultural factors and resources of a site\n\n2. methods and techniques for inventorying, recording and mapping site data\n\n3. analytical skills to evaluate and compare the worth of recorded and mapped site data\n\n4. an understanding of how to synthesize all data deriving a design program for land\nplanning which considers landform, plant form and built form and\n\n. a thorough understanding of the value and importance analysis of the natural and\ncultural resources have in environmental decision making.\n\n=\n\nNn\n\nCourse Structure\n\nThis Tuesday/Thursday course is structured to be both a lecture course and a lab course, where\nlectures are supported by with interpretive activities. The activities in the laboratory will consist\nof discussions, field trips, project critiques and audio-visual presentations. The course schedule\nidentifies the lecture topics and reading assignments.\nLA 213 Site & Terrain Analysis\nFall Quarter 2002\n\nCourse Reference Reading\nThe required reading for the course will be in the handouts, which will be given to you\nthroughout the quarter. I suggest that you purchase a 3 ring binder to put all the reading material\ninto. This reader along with all your notes will become a valuable reference for you in the future.\nOther bibliographic references on the topic of site analysis, site planning and landscape\nassessment include:\n\nDe Chiarra and Koppleman Site Planning Standards\n\nTbid., Urban Planning and Design Criteria\n\nForman, Landscape Ecology\n\nHester, Neighborhood Space\n\nLeopold, A Sand County Almanac\n\nMarsh, Environmental Analysis\n\nMcHarg, Design with Nature\n\nNavi-Lieberman, Landscape Ecology and Analysis\n\nSimonds, Landscape Architecture\n\nRobinette, Landscape Planning for Energy Conservation\n\nRutledge, Anatomy of a Park\n\nWay, Terrain Analysis\n\nRubenstein, A Guide to Site and Environmental Planning\n\nUSGS, Nature to be Commanded\n\nUSDA Soil Conservation Service, Know the Soil You Build On\n\n \n\n \n\nStudent Evaluation Criteria\n\nYou will be given assignments during the lab portion of this course on a weekly basis.\n\nEach project will take approximately one week in duration. You will be given the assignment at\nthe beginning of the week and it will be due the following week for review and discussion unless\notherwise noted. The total score for the quarter will be based on a combination of the midterm,\nlab points, as well as, participation.\n\nLate projects will not be excepted unless circumstances are discussed beforehand with\nme.

We will make leaps principally by adding new and powerful\nways of finding antiderivatives, then by using these new techniques to solve some\ninteresting applied problems. The only prerequisites for this course are good\nalgebra skills, command of derivatives, and an appreciation for the fruits of hard\nlabor.\n\nMethodology\nOur high ambitions will necessitate various vehicles for progress.\n\n1. Discussion. Class time will be spent discussing and working on math-\nematics. Your engagement in the discourse is vital. You may be called\nupon to offer your thoughts or work a problem at your desk. You will get\nout of class only what you put in.\n\n2. Homework. Homework is assigned nightly out of the book. Each week\nsome subset of the book problems will be turned in for grading, but that\nsubset will not be known in advance so it is important to give each book\nproblem due attention. “Feast or famine” is not the proper course here.\nConsistent and careful consideration of the homework is the surest path\nto success.\n\n3. Examination. There will be two midterms and a final exam at the end\nof the quarter.\n\n4. Query. Two students will be drawn randomly for a daily query at the\nbeginning of each class.\n\nEthos\n\nOur guiding belief is that we have reached a defining moment in our math-\nematical education. The development of calculus is one of the greatest intellec-\ntual achievements in the history of humankind. True understanding will come\nonly to those who vigorously seek it. We are here to become the thinkers and\nstudents we have always wanted to be.\nMath 142 Calculus II Fall 2015\n\n \n\nOffice Hours\n\nOur in-class discussions will likely be the proverbial “tip of the iceberg.” To\nfacilitate sustained mathematical discussion, there will be additional times to\nmeet throughout the week.\n\ne M 11:10-12:30.\nT 12:10-1:00.\n\nR 12:10-1:00.\nF 12:10-1:00.\n\ne By appointment.\n\nExam Dates\n\n1. Midterms:\n\ne Exam 1 Tuesday, October 13th\ne Exam 2 Friday, November 6th\n\n2. Final Exam: Monday, December 7th, 10:10am-1:00pm\n\nGrading\nCourse grades will be calculated as follows:\n@ Query (5%)\ne Homework (20%)\ne Midterm Exam (2 x 20%)\ne Final Exam (35%)\n\nAcademic Integrity\n\nIt is my opinion that there is hardly any human act more satisfying or\nimportant than the sharing of knowledge. I therefore consider the classroom\nand the university at large to be hallowed ground, well deserving of all the\nhumility and respect that we would afford our other most sacred places.\n\nPlease refer to the University’s policy on cheating and plagiarism found in\nthe Campus Administration Manual, Section 684.\n\nIn short: be sensible, respectful and mindful of the integrity of the system\nwe are all so lucky to share.\r'),

The policy regarding the use of\ntextbooks and notes will be announced at least one week prior to each exam.\n(Typically, I allow a single cheat sheet on all my exams).\nLabs and project\n\nPractical knowledge of the database modeling techniques and practical experi-\nence in building database applications will be conveyed through labs and the\ncourse project. There will be about 7-8 labs. Some labs will be standalone, while\nothers will be part of the course project. The rough lab and project schedule is\ndescribed below.\n\nWeek Lab Lab Type Project\nWeek 1 Lab 1: SQL standalone, individual —\nWeeks 2-5 Labs 2-5: Database Application project, group Design stage\ndesign and tuning\nWeek 6 Lab 6 : Security standalone Implementation Stage\nWeek 7 Lab 7: ORDBMS standalone Implementation Stage\nWeeks 8-10 Lab 8: XML standalone Implementation, Evaluation, Testing Stage\n\n \n\nEach lab assignment will span 2-4 lab sessions. Each lab assignment is due\nby the end of lab period on the due date (unless specified otherwise). You are\nwelcome to work on the lab assignments outside the lab hours, however, lab\nperiod attendance is mandatory. You may only leave the lab period (a)\nwith the express permission of the instructor if (b) the current assignment is\ncomplete and the next assignment has not been made available yet. Project-\nrelated lab assignments will be done by groups formed at the beginning of the\ncourse. Standalone lab assignments will either be individual or group — this will\nbe stated on each assignment explicitly.\n\nProject. This course will involve a quarter-long team project which will re-\nquire each team to go through all the steps of database application modeling,\ndesign and implementation. The project will have an outside customer, and the\ngoal of the project is to produce a working, usable prototype of the database\napplication, which the customer can adopt, further extend and enhance after\nthe delivery. At the beginning of the quarter, you will have opportunities to\ninteract with the customer and learn about the application desiderata (require-\nments) from him. Throughout the course, you will have opportunity to consult\nthe customer. This should allow you to fine-tune your application design to the\ncustomer needs.\n\nWhile all groups will be working on the same project, I reserve the right to\nindividualize the assignments of different groups. The specifical individualiza-\ntions may involve language of implementation, added stress on certain features,\nor certain categories of users, use of advanced database modeling techniques\n\n(ORDBMS, XML).\n\nHomeworks\n\nIn addition to labs, a number of paper-and-pencil homeworks will be assigned.\nHomeworks will typically consist of problems taken from database textbooks,\nor similarly styled problems. The primary purpose of the paper-and-pencil\nhomeworks is preparation for exams. Not all homeworks (or not all problems\nin a given homework) may end up being graded.\n\nLate Submissions\n\nAll assignments are due at classtime on the due date: homeworks - at the\nbeginning of the class (with grace period extending to the beginning of the lab\nperiod); lab assignments - at the end of the lab period. Any deviations from\nthese rules will be spelled out explicitly in the assignments.\n\nHomework/lab assignments submitted later than indicated above will be\nconsidered late submissions.\n\nIf paper-and-pencil homework solutions are distributed on the due date of\nthe homework, late homework submissions will not be accepted. Oth-\nerwise, late homeworks can be submitted during next 24 hours for a 10-30%\npenalty (the exact amount will depend on the submission time and the specific\ncircumstances). No homework submissions will be accepted afterwards.\n\nLate lab assignment submissions can be turned in before or at the beginning\nof the next lab period for a 10-30% penalty (the exact amount will depend\non the submission time and the specific cireumstances\'). No lab assignment\nsubmissions will be accepted after that.\n\nCommunication\n\nThe class will have an official mailing list. The email addresses for the sections\nare:\n\ncpe-366-01-2102@calpoly.edu for Section 01\ncpe-366-03-2102@calpoly.edu for Section 03\n\nI will typically post all announcements to both mailing lists at the same\ntime.\n\nI encourage questions during classtime and questions via email. My answers\nto email questions may be broadcast to the entire class via the mailing list, if the\nanswer may be relevant to everyone (e.g. a correction in a text of a handout,\nor a clarification of a homework problem), and may also appear on the web\npage. The questions can also be posted to the mailing list directly. The mailing\nlist will also be used for all annoucements related to the course. It is your\nresponsibility to read your class-related email. Failure to read email posted to\ncs405001 mailing list cannot be used as an excuse in the class.\n\nWeb Page\nClass web page can be found at\n\n1The penalty will be larger if the gap between the two lab periods includes a weekend and\nsmaller otherwise\n\non\nhttp: //www.csc.calpoly.edu/~dekhtyar/366-Winter2010\n\nThrough this page you will be able to access all class handouts including home-\nworks, project information and lecture notes.\n\nClass Wiki\n\nClass wiki can be found at\nhttps: / /wikibeta.csc.calpoly.edu /csc366-2010/wiki\n\nThe wiki will be used as the student-run repository of information about\nthe project. Additionally, you will use the wiki to submit all your project\ndeliverables.\n\nAcademic Integrity\n\nUniversity Policies\n\nCal Poly’s Academic Integrity policies are found at\nhttp: //www.academicprograms.calpoly.edu/academicpolicies/Cheating.htm\nIn particular, these policies define cheating as (684.1)\n\n“... obtaining or attempting to obtain, or aiding another to obtain\ncredit for work, or any improvement in evaluation of performance, by\nany dishonest or deceptive means. Cheating includes, but is not lim-\nited to: lying; copying from another’s test or examination; discussion\nof answers or questions on an examination or test, unless such\nsion is specifically authorized by the instructor; taking or receiving\ncopies of an exam without the permission of the instructor; using or\ndisplaying notes, ”cheat sheets,” or other information devices inap-\npropriate to the prescribed test conditions; allowing someone other\nthan the officially enrolled student to represent same.”\n\n  \n\n‘US-\n\nPlagiarism, per University policies is defined as (684.3)\n\n“... the act of using the ideas or work of another person or persons\nas if they were one’s own without giving proper credit to the source.\nSuch an act is not plagiarism if it is ascertained that the ideas were\narrived through independent reasoning or logic or where the thought\nor idea is common knowledge. Acknowledgement of an original au-\nthor or source must be made through appropriate references; i.e.,\nquotation marks, footnotes, or commentary.”\n\nUniversity policies state (684.2): “Cheating requires an “F” course grade and\nfurther attendance in the course is prohibited.” (appeal process is also outlined,\nsee the web site above for details.). Plagiarism, per university policies (684.4)\ncan be treated as a form of cheating, although a level of discretion is given to\nthe instructor, allowing the instuctor to determine the causes of plagiarism and\neffect other means of remedy. It is the obligation of the instructor to inform the\nstudent that a penalty is being assessed in such cases.\n\nCourse Policies\n\nAll homeworks are to be completed by each student individually. Lab assign-\nments are to be completed by the appropriate units (individual, pair, group),\nand no code/solution-sharing between units is permitted. Students are encour-\naged to discuss class content among themselves but NOT in a manner that con-\nstitutes plagiarism and cheating as defined above (e.g., you can solve together\na problem from the textbook that had not been assigned in the homework, but\nyou should solve assigned problems individually).\r'),

Creative\ncomputing emphasizes the knowledge and practices that young people need to\ncreate the types of dynamic and interactive computational media that they enjoy in\ntheir daily lives.\n\nEngaging in the creation of computational artifacts prepares young people for more\nthan careers as computer scientists or as programmers.

This course will teach you some of the important\ncomputer graphics principals of 3D games. This course is primarily focused on the\ngraphics components of interactive 3D games/worlds. We will cover advanced real-time\ngraphics techniques mostly in the context of games. This course requires substantial\nmath and programming skills. Experience with C or C++ will be essential and\nexperience with linear algebra will be very helpful. We will be using OpenGL and GLSL\nfor our graphics APIs, along with C++ to create computer graphics games throughout the\nquarter (You are required to use ‘modern graphics programming’ for all assignments*).\nYou are welcome to develop your programs under varying operating systems as long as\nthe final programs can be demonstrated and run on multiple machines for the final game\nplay demo.\n\nCourse Objectives, by the end of the quarter students will:\n\n™@ Understand and master the graphics pipeline and the basic implementation of the\npipeline in modern hardware (and graphics libraries)\n\n™@ Understand programmatic choices related to geometry in real-time games,\nincluding understanding basic vocabulary, general computation and understanding\nof trade-offs of:\n¢ Various spatial data-structures\n¢ Various culling algorithms\n* Various geometric representations (polygonal, volume, parametric, etc.)\n\n™@ Understand programmatic choices related to lighting and shading in real-time\ngames, including understanding basic vocabulary, general computation and\nunderstanding of trade-offs of:\n¢ Various global illumination algorithms (i.e. shadow algorithms, ambient\n\nocclusion, etc.)\n\n¢ Various BRDFs and deferred shading\n¢ Related technologies, including texture mapping and framebuffers\n\n@ Understand programmatic choices related to animation in real-time games,\nincluding understanding basic vocabulary, general computation and understanding\nof trade-offs of:\n¢ Introductory physically-based modeling\n* Character animation (specifically skinned meshes)\n@ Be able to program a basic game with multiple moving components and\ninteraction, shadow mapping, view frustum culling and two advanced graphics\ntechnologies from the provided list\n\nM@ Write a large C++ real-time computer graphics application either as an individual\nor on a team and experience the joy of software engineering while working on a\nlarger quarter long project.\n\nAssignments:\nM@ | pair program (5% of final grade)\n* OpenGL & C++ application\nM@ 2 follow-on individual programs (vfc and shadow mapping — 5% each)\n@ One large team or individual final programming project (45% of final grade)\n* of your team’s choice (again using OpenGL and C++)\n* project must be approved by the instructor (see final project proposal &\nrubric)\n* teams will be 1-6 people — see instructor for exceptions\n¢ all teams must meet in quarter deadlines (see syllabus for tentative\ndeadlines)\n* Note that individual assessment (grades) will be made via input from team\nmembers for each milestone.\n2 individual programming technologies (14% of final grade, 7% each)\n* OpenGL & C++ technologies integrated into group project\n* Code review required\n2 mid-term exams (10% of final grade each)\nFinal game play assessment (2% of final grade)\nParticipation (4% of final grade)\n* attend class/ talk in class or office hours interaction\n\nPlease see the program description for deadline details.

Fortunately, the\nconcepts that we cover are somewhat familiar to most of you because you see them every day in the news and in your\nother classes. The main goal of this class is to help you understand these concepts more thoroughly and the way we do this\nis by presenting these everyday concepts in a more formal fashion. However, this is often quite difficult for several reasons.\nFirst, we need to understand the language of probability and statistics then we need to use that language. To achieve this\ngoal each student needs to take on certain responsibilities. During class sessions we will be unpacking the more important\nand more challenging portions of the course material on a daily basis, so two of the student’s responsibilities are to be in\nclass and to participate in any class discussions. Another responsibility the student must take on is reading the book and\nworking homework exercises in a timely fashion.\n\nSoftware: We will be using the R software package for analyses. It matches our recommended texts which all have nice R\nexplanations. EViews, Minitab, JMP and SAS can do most everything (but not all of) we will be doing in class but because\nsome of the internal algorithms differ (slightly) across packages, answers may differ slightly. | will be able to help with R. A\nbit with Minitab and JMP. Not very much at all with SAS and not at all with EViews.\n\nRecommended Texts (should all be available in PDF or ebook format via the library):\ne Introductory Time Series with R by Cowpertwait and Metcalfe\ne Time Series Analysis with applications in R by Cryer and Chan (2nd edition)\n¢ Possibly The Analysis of Time Series: An Introduction by Chatfield (6\" edition)\ne An Introduction to Analysis of Financial Data with R by Tsay\ne Some content from Forecasting Principals and Applications by Delurgio (now out of print, so | will provide some\nPDFs)\n\nGrading Information: Your grade will be based on the following numerical score:\n\n \n\nPercent What Date(s) Additional Information\n\n10% Labs Once or twice a week ... turned in next class session for credit\n\n20% Homeworks Due at my office by 11am on Wednesdays, lowest one score dropped\n\n17% Midterm1 Oct11\n\n17% Midterm2 Nov6é\n\n36% Final Dec 13 Comprehensive but a bit more emphasis on sections not covered on earlier exams\n\nYou are encouraged to work with others on the homework assignments, but you will need to turn in your own work.

I have four main goals for students: to use sociological tools to examine local\nand international issues/problems; to draw upon sociological theory to illuminate the social forces that impact\nour everyday lives; to develop a “critical consciousness” to engage the world on a deeper and substantive level\n(and liberate ourselves); and to investigate how to be an agent of social change.\n\nRequired Texts\n\n1. Introduction to Sociology (9\" edition) by Giddens et.al. and the Contexts Reader (should come as a package)\nAvailable in the bookstore and Amazon.com. Both books are on reserve in Kennedy Library.\n\n2. Readings listed as “Polylearn” can be found on the course Polylearn.\n\n \n\nCourse Learning Objectives\nThe goals for this course are for every student to:\n1. Achieve an international/global perspective of cultures and societies along with knowledge of other\nsocial and cultural systems.\n2. Develop an understanding of the problems and implications of the United States as a multicultural,\npluralistic society.\n3. Learn to apply a holistic/integrated approach to current social problems on a local, regional and global\nlevel.\n4. Appreciate the way social groups and structures influence individual behavior and the way individual\nbehavior influences social groups and structures.\n5. Show growth in the ability to think critically concerning important issues facing our society and\nsocieties in a global perspective.\n\nClass Procedure\n\nThis class will be pedagogically “mixed method.” Recognizing the various ways in which people learn,\nmy goal is to meet you the student half way in this learning process. Below are my commitments to you and\nexpectations of you as a student.\n\nFirst, my main teaching style is lecture mixed with class discussion and activities. Lecture will be concise,\nrelevant, and is central to the way this class is designed. Therefore, you are expected to be at every class (unless\n\n1\nyou have an emergency) having read the designated material. In addition, the exams will give you the opportunity\nto show how brilliant you are. I expect that you not only understand concepts but that you can also apply them\nto real life. My commitment is to judge your knowledge and effort as well as give you insightful feedback on\nyour work.\n\nCourse Requirements Portion of Final Grade:\nReflection Paper Assignments (4 @ 10pts each) 40\nMidterm 30\nFinal Exam 30\n\nReadings\n\nReadings—do them. I have chosen to go for depth rather than breadth so time should not be an issue. I\nrecommend doing the reading and making notes in the margin, then going back later that day or the next day and\nreviewing the reading as it applies to your life. Each reading was chosen to help you nosce te ipsum (know\nthyself) and/or see the world from a different perspective.\n\nReflection Papers\nThe four reflection papers ask you to connect concepts and theories from class and the readings to your own\n\npersonal life. When you write the reflection paper, please underline the concepts or theories from readings or\nclass. I also expect you to follow the standard writing procedures on all of your assignments. This means that\nyou will: use normal margins (1 inch top and bottom, 1.25 on the sides), twelve point Times New Roman font,\ndouble space, title all of your work, and put a name and course number on everything you hand in. All work\nshould be type-written and turned in as a PDF on the polylearn by the given date. Sloppiness will be judged\naccordingly. LATE PAPERS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.\n\n \n\nMovie Reaction Paper\nThis paper is an opportunity for you to critically engage a popular medium on a deeper level. In at least two full\n\ndouble-spaced pages I want you briefly (~ 2 to 4 page) summarize the plot. With the rest of the paper, please\ninvestigate how an inequality in the movie played out (reinforced, rebuked, unquestioned, etc.), and back up your\nclaims with examples. Then discuss atleast five class concepts (UNDERLINE) and how they help you understand\nthe movie and/or inequality in a new way. This paper may be turned in at any time during the quarter but before\nthe due date. It is worth 5 points.\n\nDisaster By Drought Summit Reflection\n\nYou are required to attend at least one of the events during the Summit. Further details can be found at\nwww.disasterbydrought2015.calpoly.edu. After attending, please write at least a two double-spaced page reaction\npaper on this experience relating what you saw and felt to at least five class concepts (UNDERLINE). It is worth\n5 points.\n\n \n\n \n\nDeviance Assignment\nThe goal of the deviance assignment is to showcase invisible informal social control mechanisms we follow\n\neveryday. You are simply asked to do something that is deviant. It is best to do this assignment with a classmate.\nPlease do not do something that will either harm yourself or others or risk formal sanction. Once you have done\nyour deviance, please write at least a two page reflection relating it to at least five concepts (UNDERLINE) from\nthe lecture or the readings. Please also note what sanctions were made to control your behavior. It is worth 5\npoints.\n\nSocial Change Reflection\n\nBy the end of the quarter you will have moved beyond the privilege of ignorance and learned about various social\n\nproblems that we, consciously and unconsciously, maintain. This two page reflection asks you to think deeply\n2\nand divergently about how you can become a social change agent. Further instructions are on the polylearn site.\nIt is worth 5 points.\n\nMidterm and Final Exam\n\nThe midterm and final exam will consist of true-false, multiple choice, and short-answer questions. The true-\nfalse and multiple choice questions will gauge your knowledge of key sociological terms, concepts, and theories\nwhile the short-answer questions will have you connect these ideas to real life situations. The final will be\ncumulative although it will focus most heavily on the content after the midterm.\n\nOther Issues\n\nCheating: \\ abhor efforts by students to turn in work that is not their own or to cheat the system in other ways.\nIn my classes I take an extra effort to make sure that this does not happen. If I find a student has cheated, I will\nmake sure the student is punished to the fullest extent by the Scholastic Conduct Committee. If you think that you\nmay do this, I recommend taking another class.\n\nLate and Make up policy: Tardiness is not accepted in other work environments and will not be accepted in this\nclass. Late homework and papers will not be accepted unless there is documented illness/other emergency.\nYou can always turn in homework early! If it is an emergency, please see me individually BEFORE the\nassignment is due. Homework sent by email will not be accepted.\n\nIncompletes: No incompletes will be given unless you have a prior written agreement with me and will only be\ngiven out in rare situations with extenuating circumstances present.\n\nClassroom Behavior: This is a college-level class. Therefore, I will treat you like adults. I expect you to\nparticipate often, engage the material both critically and constructively, and to the have the highest respect for\nothers, even if you disagree with what they say. We will have intellectual discussions, not petty arguments. It is\nmy duty as an instructor to ensure that each student feels safe and respected when speaking in the classroom.\nDisruptive and disrespectful behavior will not be tolerated. If problems arise we will not spend class time solving\nthem. You will be asked to leave and we will work on a solution after class. Remember, both learning and\nteaching requires humility. Open yourself up to being changed.\n\n \n\nCell phones and Computers: | believe that talking on the phone or texting during class is disrespectful of the\nprofessor and of other students. Cell phones are not permitted to be out during class. Computers are an\nextremely important part of our society but can also be a significant source of distraction. Therefore, computers\nwill not be permitted in class unless you obtain my permission first in office hours. This right can be taken\naway if the privilege is abused. Please see the article “Why I’m asking you not to use laptops” on the polylearn\nfor further justification.\n\nEmail: The simplicity of writing emails, I believe, has encouraged students to email their professor at every whim.\nI received dozens of emails last quarter in which the answer could have been found in the syllabus, from a\nclassmate, during class, or during office hours. Please only email me if it is critically urgent.\n\nDisabilities: It is University policy to provide, on a flexible and individualized basis, reasonable accommodations\nto students who have disabilities that may affect their ability to participate in course activities or to meet course\nrequirements. I encourage you to contact me to discuss any individual needs for accommodations. The sooner\nyou do the better.\nDisclaimer: While I believe that it is important to treat the syllabus as a contract between us, I also reserve the\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nright to make minor changes in the course as I see necessary. That said, I will do my best to maintain the syllabus\nas-is and if changes need to be made, | will alert the class in a timely and appropriate manner.\nWHEN YOU ARE NOT SURE ABOUT SOMETHING OR HAVE A QUESTION:\n1. First re-read the syllabus; 2. Then check Polylearn; 3. Then check with a classmate; 4.Then wait until\nclass or office hours; 5. Or if it is an emergency—then email me.\nWeek | Date: Themes Readings do on Tues- Readings Due on Thurs- Assignments\nWeek Giddens et. al.

My choice\nwill be announced in class and posted on the class web page at least one week before the final.\n\nAll written material will be graded for clarity and content. Note that poor spelling and grammar\naffect the clarity of the material. The instructor is not a proof reader and may not catch all of your\nspelling or grammar errors. Those that he does find will, however, cause deductions in the grade.\n\nThe instructor reserves the right to assign different individual grades on a group lab project based\non an individual’s contribution to that deliverable.

If the amount of work in a category is very different from what I expect, I may change\nthe weightings within the bounds given above. Any change would be announced in class before the\nend of the quarter.\n\nThe above percentages notwithstanding, the instructor reserves the right to give a failing grade\nin the class if\na. any grading category is missing\n\nb. You flunk the final\n\nc. You do not get the equivalent of a “C” on the formal oral presentation.\nd. You do not get a passing grade on the paper\n\ne. You do not participate in CSC 300 (as shown in class & documented in your notebook).\n\nCOURSE CONTENT:\n\nNOTE: While many things may appear similar to my course in previous quarters (and many things\nare), this quarter is a separate self-contained entity. Be sure to read the material specifically for this\nquarter because there may be subtle and important differences between this quarter and a previous\nquarter.\n\nThe course is titled “Professional Responsibilities” but it covers more than a discussion of what is\nrequired of a computer science professional. Certainly part of being a professional is behaving\nethically according to the accepted norms of the profession, and we will indeed discuss professional\nethics. But we will also cover the general ethical implications of computer use by anyone, not just\nprofessionals. Professionals should also know the effect that their work has on society, so we will also\ndiscuss the social implications of the use of computers. Professionals today also work in a regulatory\nand legal environment of which they must be aware and we will discuss some of those issues.\n\nThe course is intended to make you aware of issues. When we discuss topics, especially the ethical\ntopics, I will not be presenting you with a prescribed set of beliefs, opinions, or ethical values. In other\nwords, I will not generally be telling you what you should do in a particular situation. The point of the\ncourse is for you to know the range of ethical or social or legal questions involved in a situation so that\nyou can then apply your own ethics and beliefs to the facts of the situation.\n\nWhile these may sound like “soft” topics, this course assumes a technical background and we will\ndiscuss the topics assuming we all understand the technology and its limits. These topics are so\nimportant that they are explicitly required of all accredited computer science programs. (We also will\ndiscuss what accreditation means.)\n\nAnother important part of this course is to give you experience in making professionally competent\noral and written presentations in a technical setting. When we ask our industrial advisory council\n(composed of the kind of people who will hire you when you get your degree) what they want from\nour graduates, the first thing they list is the ability to communicate (both orally and in writing), and to\nwork in groups. I have sat in on meetings with such groups at both the department level (i.e. just\ncomputer science people) and at the college level (i.e. with people from all branches of engineering).\nThe response is the same at either level.\n\nAs you will see from the details below, written communication will also be an important part of\nthis course.\n\nFinally, you should have fun (yes, I said fun) with this course. I expect spirited discussions, even\ncontroversies to pop up in class. The oral presentations, both formal and informal, should just be the\nstarting points for further discussion. Think of it this way, you will not get a single compiler error\nmessage from the work in this course -- what could be more fun than THAT?\nCLASS COMMUNICATION\n\nThe best communication medium is our classroom; there will be lots of time available to ask\nquestions and for discussion of the topics. Indeed, class participation is a full 10% of your grade.\n\nElectronic mail is another medium for communication with me. Please be sure to include a subject\nline with your email message that makes it clear the question is about CSC 300. I may miss or delay\nreading messages that have blank or ambiguous subject lines.\n\nLast, but not least, are the class Web pages. There you will find assignments and other information.\nThe web pages will not be static entities. As the course progresses, new items will be added. For\nexample, the descriptions of the readings, projects, and assignments for the quarter will grow during\nthe quarter; the content you see now will not describe the entire quarter’s work. Note the address\nabove; the web page is not currently reachable from the department home page via my name among\nthe faculty.\n\nTHE PAPER\nDetails of the paper will be forthcoming in Part 2 of the syllabus.\n\nORAL PRESENTATIONS\nEach student is required to give oral presentations in class as follows:\n\n¢ Informal oral presentations of no longer than 2 minutes.\nIam still debating how many will be required. See Syllabus Part 2 for the result of that debate.\n\n \n\nThe presentations can be on anything pertinent to the responsibilities of a computer science\nprofessional. Informal presentations are not scheduled but may limited on a particular day at the\ndiscretion of the instructor. The limit on a day by be as few as none but more typically about 5\nper hour of class. Ideas: press releases, news articles, history tidbits, TV shows, journal articles,\njokes, Dilbert cartoons, ... See the course web site for a list of possible topic areas if you have\ntrouble coming up with one. The list on the web site is only a list of suggestions; you are\nencouraged to find a topic not on the list if it interests you. Topics cannot be presented by more\nthan one student except as a response or to present additional information that became available\nafter the initial presentation on the topic. You may give only | two-minute talk per class period -\n- plan ahead.\n\nKeep a short abstract of each presentation clearly marked (including the date you presented it) in\nyour notebook. Also, hand in to me some hardcopy representation of the source of your talk. This\ncould be a newspaper clipping (or photocopy), printout of a web page, copy of a picture, etc. Be\nsure you have your name and the date on this! Without any hardcopy and any indication in your\nnotebook of you giving the presentation, it will not be counted. At least one presentation must be\ncompleted or the “Informal Oral Presentation” grade category will be deemed missing and you will\ntherefore fail the course (see above). Grading in the case of only one out of two presentations may\nnot necessarily be linear.\n\nThese presentations will not be scheduled, but you are responsible for completing all of them. Note\n\nthat with disucussion following a presentation much more than two minutes may be taken up with\nthese “two-minute” talks. Indeed, some class periods may be completely taken up with discussion\n\n-3-\nof topics raised by the two-minute talks. I EXPECT participation; that, too, is part of your grade.\nAlso note that once 10-minute talks start there will be less time for two-minute talks.\n\nCredit for these presentations will be based on the quality of your presentation and the relevance\nand timeliness of the topic to the class.\n\n¢ One formal oral presentation (of approximately 10 minutes) on a topic pertinent to the\nresponsibilities of a computer science professional. The topic of your talk may be the same as that\nof your paper, or it may be on another subject. The date of your talk must be scheduled in advance;\ntopics must be approved at least one week in advance of the talk. Proposal and approval of topics\nand dates will only be done through e-mail. In case of multiple requests for the same topic or date,\nfirst time-stamp on the e-mail wins. Overheads must be preapproved by the instructor at least two\nweekdays prior to the presentation. (E.g., approval no later than Thursday for a Monday talk.)\nThis allows time for you to modify the overheads if necessary before final approval. You may sign\nup for a date without a topic or a topic without a date, but all respective deadlines must be met\nbefore the talk is given. Failure to meet these two approval deadlines will result in the\ncancellation of the talk. Note that timeslots for these talks are limited and that failure to give the\ntalk will result in failing the class due to lack of the grading category.\n\n \n\nApproval of the overheads must be done in person in my office -- no e-mails or dropped-off copies\nwill be allowed. Also please bring hard-copy so that I can write on the draft pages. These\nrequirements are so that I can make comments and ask questions about the details of the slides and\nyour presentation. Rough drafts (even hand-written ones) are acceptable for my first viewing of\nthe slides, but the rougher the initial draft, the more likely approval will be delayed to another time.\n\nThe valid topics and content of the papers and 10-minute talks are wide-ranging. One content\nrequirement that will be imposed is that each talk must relate the topic to any relevant sections of\nSoftware Engineering and ACM Codes of Ethics (see the “Week 2” reading assignments on the\nweb site for more information on these codes).\n\nGROUP LAB PROJECTS\n\nEach student will be in a lab group. You will form yourselves into groups by the end of the first\nweek of class. This is the fourth time I have taught the class with labs so I may still experiment\nsomewhat in how I use the lab time. The lab work will consist of a series of projects. Each group is\nresponsible for knowing the project due dates. Projects are required work; you must complete them to\npass CSC 300. Lexpect you to attend both the lecture section and the lab section! Based on the\nequipment in each room and what I want to present, I might do “lab-like” activities in the lecture time\nand vice versa.\n\nCOURSE NOTEBOOK\n\nEach student is required to maintain a course notebook containing the material listed in the\nfollowing bullets. Notebooks will be collected on a sporadic basis during Wednesday class time. In\nany given week, the instructor may collect all notebooks, a random selection, a semi-random or even\ncapricious selection, or ask for voluntary submissions. (If voluntary submissions are collected,\ncollections subsequent weeks may be additional voluntary submissions, or a “catch up” request for\nall notebooks not already volunteered.) The point for you to remember is that you must do the\nwork each week and be prepared to hand it in on the due date, even if your notebook is not collected\nthat week.\n\nMaterial in the notebook must be organized chronologically, by week -- first week first, so it is\neasy to find. The assignment page lists reading assignments, individual assignments, and in\ngeneral summarizes what should be added to your notebook each week. Material in the notebook\ncan be handwritten if your handwriting is legible\n\nNOTE that this “notebook” is NOT the same as the notes you would be taking in\n\nclass for your own use. It should contain just the things requested. You should\nmaintain separate books or pages for your own use for taking notes in class.\n\n¢ Reading reactions (quality will be part of the individual assignments grade)\n\nWrite informal comments, in complete sentences, giving your reaction to each assigned\nreading. Do NOT summarize the reading; I want you to react to what you read. And\nplease don\'t do bullet writing! The comments should include some or all of the following\ndepending on your interest or reaction:\n\na. Your reaction to key ideas\n\nb. Ideas you find surprising or new\n\nc. Evidence given for or against the author\'s arguments\n\nd. Relationship of the material to other articles or class discussion\n\ne. Problems you see with the author\'s arguments\n\nA reading reaction is required for each assigned chapter or paper and must be a minimum\nof 200 words. In some cases, more words may be required to express your thoughts.\n\nYou do not need to react to each topic within a given assignment or separately to each sec-\ntion of areading. You may react to the reading as a whole or pick out some particular issue\nraised and react just to that.\n\n+ Individual Assignments_\n\nYou will receive a number of assignments during the quarter; these are to be completed by\nyourself. Most of these will be exercises from the book with the answers to be placed in\nthe notebook (see the assignments web page for specific details). Some assignments may\nalso ask you to submit assignment deliverables separate from your notebook, but always\nkeep all of your assignments in the notebook.\n\nInformal Oral Presentation summaries\n\n \n\nWrite a short summary of each two minute report you give in class including the date and\nthe topic discussed. This will be part of the documentation that you in fact gave the\ntalk (along with the written artifact you must give me). Without this documentation\nthe 2-minute talk will not be counted as being given.\n¢ Other Participation (1 entry per week)\nDocument anything that demonstrates your active participation in CSC 300. Participation\nactivities might include outside reading or active class participation.\n\n \n\nPossible Grading Non-linearity\n\nPlease note that in those grading areas where a number of repetitions of an item are required,\n(class participation, notebook handins, two-minute talks, and individual assignments) the grade if\nthere are missing repetitions may not be linear. For example, handing in the notebook only half\nthe time it is requested will NOT necessarily get you half the points for the notebook, but likely\nmuch fewer than half.\n\nPLAGIARISM\n\nCooperative work is an important part of learning and especially this course. You are\nencouraged to study together, discuss the class and its many issues, but all assignments and tests\nare expected to be your own individual work. Failure to do so is cheating. Copying work from\noutside sources without credit is also cheating. Cheating may result in penalties as severe as\nfailure of the course or worse, depending on the severity of the cheating.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT\n\nWhile the specifics of this syllabus are mine, I am indebted to Professor Dan Stearns for the\nbasic design and the original definition of this course as well as for the base text from which I have\nadapted this syllabus. I more recently have also stolen a refinement or two from Professor Clark\nTurner’s syllabus.\r'),

Handouts, course information, and extra features such as FAQs and useful links will be posted\non my website. Refer to it often throughout the course.\n\n2. Do not e-mail me with homework questions. Instead, see me during office hours.\n\n3. Hints for Success: (1) READ THE BOOK. (2) DO ALL THE HOMEWORK. (3) See me\nduring office hours. (3) Use tutoring sessions, available through the ME department. (4) Form a\nstudy group.\n\n4. Notes regarding homework assignments:\n\na.\n\nSolutions will be posted outside my office after they are due. They will be left up for only\na few days after you get your assignment back, so check them quickly. Don’t waste your\ntime copying solutions. The idea of posted solutions is for you to correct your solutions, not\nto copy mine.\n\n. Assignments are due on my desk at the beginning of class. This rule expedites the\n\ncollection of homework, but I employ this rule mainly because it is better for you. Some\nstudents would be tempted to complete their assignment during class, which gives them an\nunfair advantage. Also, if you work on the assignment during class, you miss the current\nlecture.\n\n. Late assignments will not be accepted, and five minutes late is considered late. One\n\npurpose of this rule is that it encourages your coming to class on time. Another reason for this\ntule is that the solutions are posted outside my door after class, so allowing students any extra\ntime would give them an unfair advantage over the rest of the class. Moreover, I sometimes\ndiscuss solutions to assignments during the first few minutes of class, which could easily be\ncopied and turned in.\n\n. Do not ask for extra time. Leaving your assignment at home is not an acceptable excuse. I\n\nused to allow students to turn in assignments late, but students have taken unfair advantage of\nthis, and as a result I can no longer accept late assignments. If you have any special\ncircumstances that prevent you from attending class on time, please see me so that we can\nmake arrangements.\n\nDo not quibble over your homework grade. One or two points taken off of one homework\nassignment, whether you think it was undeserved or just “too harsh,” will have little effect on\nyour overall grade. Besides, the grader is likely to make just as many mistakes in your favor\nover the course of the quarter. However, if you have a larger error to report, please bring it to\nmy attention.\n\nAssignments will be done in a professional manner and format. Sloppy and/or\ndisorganized work will be penalized. As an engineer, you must exercise good engineering\nmethodology, problem solving, and communication. Your assignment grade will therefore be\nbased partly on your ability to present your work professionally.\n\n. All Assignments are to be worked individually. You may work together on homework\n\nassignments, but to simply copy another’s work is unethical and considered cheating (see next\nitem).\n\n5. In order to maintain the quality and reputation of your education, academic dishonesty of any kind\nwill be punished. Students caught cheating will receive an F, and be reported to Academic Affairs.\r'),

Your final evaluation\nis a long presentation (Assignment 6), a 20 min. presenation of your thesis\nresearch topic.\nAssignments\n\nThe course involves three types of assignments: reading assignments, writing\nassignments and oral presentations.\n\nReading Assignmnets\n\nThere will be two key reading assignments in the course:\n\nThesis reading and critique: you will select a number of M.S. thesis doc-\numents from past Cal Poly M.S. in Computer Science students. You\nwill read these documents, and you will prepare and present your as-\nsessment /critique of them.\n\nRelevant literature: you will be asked to prepare a bibliography of academic\nliterature relevant to your thesis/research topic. You will then be asked\nto read a number of papers from your bibliography.\n\nWriting Assignments\nThe course will have the following writing assignments:\n\nResearch Blurb/Thesis Intro: you will write a succinct introduction to your\nresearch area. This introduction should provide an overview of the broad\nreasearch area within which you are conducting your thesis research and\nshould motivate your specific thesis research. As such, this text can be\nviewed as a draft of your thesis introduction section.\n\nExperimental design: you will come up with a validation framework for your\nthesis (creative part of the assignment) and present a short write-up de-\nscribing it (writing part of the assignmnet). This can eventually become\npart of the Validation section of your thesis.\n\nBackground/Related work writeup : based on your bibliography of re-\nlated work you will provide a succinct writeup detailing the background\ninformation relevant to your thesis research topic. This may later morph\ninto Related Work or Background sections of your thesis.\n\n \n\nOral Presentation Assignments\n\nYou will formally deliver two presentations in this course:\n\nShort presentation: A short (up to 5 mins) presentation describing the es-\nsense of your thesis research in terms accessible to your peers.\n\nLong(er) presentation: A longer (15-20 mins) presentation describing your\nthesis research in more technical terms. This may serve as a prototype of\nyour eventual thesis presenation.\nOther Assignments\n\nThere may be other assignments in the course:\n\ne M.S. Defense attendance. If any M.S. defenses are scheduled this\nquarter, we will attend them (ideally, ’\'d want everyone to attend 1-2\ndefenses).\n\ne Peer reviews. Some class activities may involve peer reviews of material\nproduced by others (e.g., past theses) or by other students in the course\n(e.g., their wiki submissions).\n\ne Writing Improvement. Using the techniques suggested in the Williams\nand Bizup book, improve your writing (or suggest improvements to writing\nof your peer(s).\n\nThese activities will count under the ”Course Participation” line from the\ngrading procedures table above.\nWeb Page\nClass web page can be found at\nhttp: //www.csc.calpoly.edu/~dekhtyar/590-Spring2019\n\nThrough this page you will be able to access all class handouts including\nhomeworks, project information, reading materials and lecture notes (should\nthe latter be written).\n\nWiki\nWe will use a CSC 590 Github Wiki in this class for a variety of assignments.\nAll of you will have individual wiki pages, and will upload your work to them.\nAdditionally, you will contribute to the contents of other existing wiki pages.\nWe will set up the wiki during the first week of classes and you will get access\nto it by the end of the week.,\nAcademic Integrity\nUniversity Policies\nCal Poly’s Academic Integrity policies are found at\nhttp: //www.academicprograms.calpoly.edu/academicpolicies/Cheating.htm\n\nIn particular, these policies define cheating as (684.1)\n“... obtaining or attempting to obtain, or aiding another to obtain\ncredit for work, or any improvement in evaluation of performance, by\nany dishonest or deceptive means. Cheating includes, but is not lim-\nited to: lying; copying from another’s test or examination; discussion\nof answers or questions on an examination or test, unless such discus-\nsion is specifically authorized by the instructor; taking or receiving\ncopies of an exam without the permission of the instructor; using or\ndisplaying notes, ”cheat sheets,” or other information devices inap-\npropriate to the prescribed test conditions; allowing someone other\nthan the officially enrolled student to represent same.”\n\nPlagiarism, per University policies is defined as (684.3)\n\n“... the act of using the ideas or work of another person or persons\nas if they were one’s own without giving proper credit to the source.\nSuch an act is not plagiarism if it is ascertained that the ideas were\narrived through independent reasoning or logic or where the thought\nor idea is common knowledge. Acknowledgement of an original au-\nthor or source must be made through appropriate references; i.e.,\nquotation marks, footnotes, or commentary.”\n\nUniversity policies state (684.2): “Cheating requires an “F” course grade and\nfurther attendance in the course is prohibited.” (appeal process is also outlined,\nsee the web site above for details.). Plagiarism, per university policies (684.4)\ncan be treated as a form of cheating, although a level of discretion is given to\nthe instructor, allowing the instuctor to determine the causes of plagiarism and\neffect other means of remedy. It is the obligation of the instructor to inform the\nstudent that a penalty is being assessed in such cases.\n\n \n\nCourse Policies\n\nFirst, all traditional warnings concerning cheating apply in this course. In par-\nticular, solicitation of help from people not involved in the course and submission\nof materials/code etc.. not developed by you are absolutely prohibited. Any\noutside materials used in preparation of homeworks, reports, project assign-\nments must be properly documents. For example, you must properly cite all\npapers you refer to, all web resources used in perparation. You must also note\nany open source, off-the-shelf, etc...software or code fragments that you have\nincorporated in your solution. If you have questions concerning allowable use of\nsuch materials, please consult me in advance.\n\nFor example, if an assignment is to design and implement an XML parser,\nyou are supposed to build one from scratch and not use any available parser\ncode (which is plentiful). On the other hand, if you want to use an open-source\nlibrary, or some code developed by one of the team members prior to the course\nas part of a project solution, this may qualify as allowable use, if the code is\nused in support of the main tasks of the project.\r'),

Kurfess, Cal Poly Computer Science Department (http://www.csc.calpoly.edu/~fkurfess/)\n\nOffice Hours\n\nMy office hours are tentatively scheduled for Tue/Thu 2:10-3:00 pm, and Wed 2:10-5:00 pm. My office is in building 14,\nroom 218.\n\nClass Times\n\n+ Lecture: TuTh 3:10PM - 4:30PM in 14-257\n« Lab: TuTh 4:40PM - 6:00PM in 14-257\n\nCourse Description\n\n\"In-depth treatment of knowledge representation, utilization and acquisition in a programming environment. Emphasis on\nthe use of domain-specific knowledge to obtain expert performance in programs.\" [from the Cal Poly Catalog 2007-09].\nPrerequisites: CSC 480 (Artificial Intelligence)\n\nGoals and Objectives\n\nThe goal of the course is to understand important problems, challenges, concepts and techniques from the field of\nKnowledge-Based Systems. In order to achieve this, students learn how to analyze, design, and implement programs and\nsystems of varying complexities. The core aspect of these systems is their ability to deal with knowledge in various forms.\nThis includes the acquisition of knowledge from human experts, computer-based knowledge repositories, or via learning\ntechniques from raw data such as delivered by sensors or data bases. Knowledge also has to be stored in an internal\nformat that is suitable for computer-based storage and processing, while still being accessible to human inspection. Then\nknowledge needs to be processed, where one important activity is the generation of new knowledge from existing pieces.\nBased on the new and existing knowledge, decisions must be made for the system, or agents involved with or served by it,\nto perform some actions. For many systems, an explanation or verification of their suggestions in a format understandable\nby developers, domain experts or regular users can be important.\n\nTextbooks\n\nI am restructuring the contents of the course to include more recent developments in the area of Knowledge-Based\nSystems, in particular the use of ontologies and related methods that have become popular in connection with the\nSemantic Web. The slides I’m using for the lecture will be available through this Web page; see the links from the topic\nentries in the schedule.\n\nTo my knowledge, there are no textbooks available that cover the course topics well. The books below provide background\nfor the main topics in the class. There is a column in the course schedule which indicates the chapters in the books that\ncorrespond to a topic discussed in class. I will also indicate other resources that provide relevant information.\n\nSemantic Web\n« Dean Allemang and James Hendler: Semantic Web for the Working Ontologist. Morgan Kaufmann, 2nd edition,\n\n2009 [Amazon].\n« P. Hitzler, M. Krétzsch, and S. Rudolph: Foundations of Semantic Web Technologies. Chapman & Hall/CRC\n\nTextbooks in Computing, 2009.

ISBN-13: 978-3642159695 [Amazon].\n\nExpert Systems\n\nIn the past, when the emphasis of the course was on expert systems, I have used the textbooks listed below. Some of them\nseem to have been updated to reflect more recent developments.\n\ne Rajendra A. Akerkar and Priti S.

Prentice Hall, 2003.\nISBN 0-13-790395-2 [Amazon]. This it the CPE/CSC 480 textbook, and it has some material related to the contents\nof this course. The structure and emphasis, however, are a bit different, concentrating more on fundamental principles.\n(The first edition of this book is also sufficient, and the 3rd edition is now available as well).\n\n \n\nA very nice overview of the literature on expert systems is at the Web site of the American Association of Artificial\nIntelligence (AAAI), http://www.aaai.org/AITopics/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/AITopics/ExpertSystems. It contains links to many\nonline articles and resources on knowledge-based systems.\n\nProtégé, Jess, and CLIPS\n\nFor some assignments, lab exercises, and the term project, we will use the Protégé ontology environment, and the CLIPS or\nJess expert system shells.\n\nProtégé (http://protege.stanford.edu/) is an ontology development environment made available by Stanford University’s\nCenter for Biomedical Informatics Research. It is widely used in academic and real-world environments for knowledge\nsolutions in a wide variety of domains. It is based on Java, and can be used in combination with other technologies relevant\nfor knowledge-based systems. The Protégé Website has a nice collection of background material such as tutorials, papers and\ntechnical reports, and presentations; see http://protege.stanford.edu/doc/users.html. A Protégé tutorial intended for students in\nthis class is at https://wiki.csc.calpoly .edu/OntologyTutorial/wiki/IntroductionToOntologiesWithProtege.\n\nCLIPS is a shell developed at NASA, and has been in use for quite a while. Jess was inspired by CLIPS, and uses the same\nrule format and inference mechanism, but it is implemented in and integrated with Java. Both are available for download via\nthe Web, and are installed on the lab systems (although not necessarily the most recent versions). Jess is subject to some\nlicensing restrictions, and you may have to use a limited evaluation version if you want to install it on your own system.\nSome textbooks also contain chapters on CLIPS, e.g. Gonzalez & Dankel,or Giarratano & Riley. Ernest Friedman-Hill, the\ndeveloper of Jess, is the author of \"Jess in Action,\" with an introduction to Jess and a number of examples. CLIPS and\nrelated material is available for download from the Web sites below (some of the links unfortunately have become obsolete).\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n« CLIPS Home Page (http: //www.siliconvalleyone.com/clips.htm) CLIPS on Sourceforge\n(http: //clipsrules. sourceforge. net.\n\ne CLIPS Tutorial (http: //iweb.tntech.edu/bhuguenard/ds6530/ClipsTutorial/tableOfContents.htm)\ndeveloped by Peter Robinson at the University of Hull in Great Britain\nThe Jess Home Page contains a lot of material, and also links to related documents.\n\ne Jess Home Page (http: //herzberg.ca.sandia.qov/jess/)\ne There have been several Jess tutorials available online, but their URLs don\'t seem to be stable.

I reserve the right, however, to change the formula used.\nPlease note that the project consists of several parts which will be evaluated separately. The project will also be done in\nteams, and the performance of the team as a whole will be graded unless there is a clear disparity in the contribution of the\n\nindividual team members. Should this be the case, I may ask for additional information about individual contributions.\n\n© 2012 Franz Kurfess Contact\r'),

During the course, the students will learn the\ntechniques for building relational database models for applications and tuning\ndatabase design for best performance, will obtain experience in building an\nactual database application and will learn the basic concepts of non-relational\ndatabase modeling and work with non-relational database management systems.\n\nTexbook\n\nRequired: Database Systems: The Complete Book (3rd Edition), Jeffrey D.\nUllman, Jennifer Widom, Hector Garcia-Molina, 2009, Prentice Hall.\nAlternative: A First Course in Database Systems (3rd Edition), Jeffrey D.\nUllman, Jennifer Widom, 2007, Prentice Hall.\n\nTopics\n\nThe following will be covered in the course.\n\n  \n\nDuration\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(weeks)\n\n1. Introduction: Database Modeling 1\n2. Conceptual Modeling using Entity-Relationship models 2\n3. Database Tuning, Functional Dependencies, Theory of Normal Forms | 2\n\nMidterm Topics 1 — 3.\n1 Data Warehouse design 1\n4. Database Security 1\n5 Non-Relational Database Design 3\n\nFinal Exam Comprehensive\n\n \n\n \n\nMost of the topics will be covered in the order specified above, but some\nvariations are possible during the course.\n\nGrading\n\nHomeworks 0-5%\nLabs and Project 35-50%\nExams 40-50%\n\nI give relatively hard problems and take points off on exams. Because of this,\nthe traditional 90-A, 80-B, 70-C grading schema does not work in my classes.\nHistorically, the A/B cutoff has been around 80-85%, while the B/C cutoff has\nbeen around 70%.\n\n \n\nCourse Policies\n\nExams\n\nThe course will involve a lot of project-related activities during the Finals week,\ntherefore, we will not have a final exam (which would otherwise have to take\nplace on Wednesday).\n\nInstead, there will be two midterm exams scheduled for the following dates:\n\n1. Midterm 1: (tentative date) Monday, May 6 (or any other class during\nWeek 6).\n\n2. Midterm 2: Friday, June 7.\nMake-up exams will not be given, unless there are extraordinary circum-\nstances present and I am notified in advance. The policy regarding the use of\ntextbooks and notes will be announced at least one week prior to each exam.\n(Typically, I allow a single cheat sheet on all my exams).\n\nLabs and project\n\nPractical knowledge of the database modeling techniques and practical experi-\nence in building database applications will be conveyed through labs and the\ncourse project.\n\nLab 1 is designed to test your knowledge of SQL. Unlike previous years,\nwhere Lab 1 was administered more as a quiz, this time Lab 1 is a week-long\nlab.\n\nLabs 2 — 5 are design labs for the course project (see below). These labs will\nrun through the end of Week 6 of the course.\n\nDuring the last four weeks of the quarter, additional standalone labs may be\ngiven on occasion to provide hands-on experience with non-relational database\ndesign and with the work of non-relational DBMS. In parallel with the stan-\ndalone labs you will be working in your teams on the project — some of the lab\nperiods will be dedicated to team work and meeting with the customer.\n\nEach lab assignment will span 2-4 lab sessions. Each lab assignment is due\nby the end of lab period on the due date (unless specified otherwise). You are\nwelcome to work on the lab assignments outside the lab hours, however, lab\nperiod attendance is mandatory. Project-related lab assignments will be\ndone in groups formed at the beginning of the course. Standalone lab assign-\nments will either be individual or group — this will be stated on each assignment\nexplicitly.\n\nProject. This course involves a quarter-long team project which will require\neach team to go through all the steps of database application modeling, de-\nsign and implementation. The project will have an outside customer, and the\ngoal of the project is to produce a working, usable prototype of the database\napplication, which the customer can adopt, further extend and enhance after\nthe delivery. At the beginning of the quarter, you will have opportunities to\ninteract with the customer and learn about the application desiderata (require-\nments) from him. Throughout the course, you will have opportunity to consult\nthe customer. This should allow you to fine-tune your application design to the\ncustomer needs.\n\nThis year, we have one customer and all teams will be working on the same\nproject. However I reserve the right to individualize the assignments of different\ngroups. The specifical individualizations may involve language of implementa-\ntion, added stress on certain features, or certain categories of users, use of\nadvanced database modeling techniques, or implementation of additional use\ncases.\nHomeworks\n\nIn addition to labs, a number of paper-and-pencil homeworks will be assigned.\nHomeworks will typically consist of problems taken from database textbooks,\nor similarly styled problems. The primary purpose of the paper-and-pencil\nhomeworks is preparation for exams. Not all homeworks (or not all problems\nin a given homework) may end up being graded.\n\nSenioritis\n\nFor some of you, this may be the last quarter at Cal Poly. CSC 366 is a technical\nelective, and therefore, I occasionally observe the attitude of ”I am done here,\nsee ya\'ll” on the part of graduating seniors when this class is offered in the\nSpring quarter.\n\nPlease know this:\n\n1. The core of the class is a team project. Do not stand up your teammates.\n\n2. Your project will have a real outside customer, and the outcomes of the\nproject may be used for an actual deployment. You are expected to treat\nthis as real professional engagement, like those you are about to start\nhaving in your professional career. Think of this as a precursor for what is\ncoming, not as the last class that stands between you and piles of money.\n\nIf any behavior due to senioritis becomes detrimental to your team, I will\nnot hesitate to lower grades accordingly.\n\nLate Submissions\n\nAll assignments, unless stated otherwise, are due at classtime on the due date:\nhomeworks - at the beginning of the class (with grace period extending to the\nbeginning of the lab period); lab assignments - at the end of the lab period. Any\ndeviations from these rules will be spelled out explicitly in the assignments.\n\nHomework/lab assignments submitted later than indicated above will be\nconsidered late submissions.\n\nIf paper-and-pencil homework solutions are distributed on the due date of\nthe homework, late homework submissions will not be accepted. Oth-\nerwise, late homeworks can be submitted during next 24 hours for a 10-30%\npenalty (the exact amount will depend on the submission time and the specific\n\n \n\ncircumstances). No homework submissions will be accepted afterwards.\n\nLate lab assignment submissions can be turned in before or at the beginning\nof the next lab period for a 10-30% penalty (the exact amount will depend\non the submission time and the specific circumstances\'). No lab assignment\nsubmissions will be accepted after that.\n\n1The penalty will be larger if the gap between the two lab periods includes a weekend and\nsmaller otherwise\nCommunication\nThe class has the following official mailing list\ncsc-366-01-2194 @calpoly. edu\n\nI encourage questions during classtime and questions via email. My answers\nto email questions may be broadcast to the entire class via the mailing list, if the\nanswer may be relevant to everyone (e.g. a correction in a text of a handout,\nor a clarification of a homework problem), and may also appear on the web\npage. The questions can also be posted to the mailing list directly. The mailing\nlist will also be used for all annoucements related to the course. It is your\nresponsibility to read your class-related email. Failure to read email posted to\ncs405001 mailing list cannot be used as an excuse in the class.\n\nWeb Page\nClass web page can be found at\nhttp: //www.csc.calpoly.edu/~dekhtyar/366-Spring2019/\n\nThrough this page you will be able to access all class handouts including home-\nworks, project information and lecture notes.\n\n \n\nAcademic Integrity\n\nUniversity Policies\n\nCal Poly’s Academic Integrity policies are found at\nhttp: //www.academicprograms.calpoly.edu/academicpolicies/Cheating.htm\nIn particular, these policies define cheating as (684.1)\n\n“... obtaining or attempting to obtain, or aiding another to obtain\ncredit for work, or any improvement in evaluation of performance, by\nany dishonest or deceptive means. Cheating includes, but is not lim-\nited to: lying; copying from another’s test or examination; discussion\nof answers or questions on an examination or test, unless such discus-\nsion is specifically authorized by the instructor; taking or receiving\ncopies of an exam without the permission of the instructor; using or\ndisplaying notes, ”cheat sheets,” or other information devices inap-\npropriate to the prescribed test conditions; allowing someone other\nthan the officially enrolled student to represent same.”\n\nPlagiarism, per University policies is defined as (684.3)\n\n“... the act of using the ideas or work of another person or persons\nas if they were one’s own without giving proper credit to the source.\nSuch an act is not plagiarism if it is ascertained that the ideas were\n\non\narrived through independent reasoning or logic or where the thought\nor idea is common knowledge. Acknowledgement of an original au-\nthor or source must be made through appropriate references; i.e.,\nquotation marks, footnotes, or commentary.”\n\nUniversity policies state (684.2): “Cheating requires an “F” course grade and\nfurther attendance in the course is prohibited.” (appeal process is also outlined,\nsee the web site above for details.). Plagiarism, per university policies (684.4)\ncan be treated as a form of cheating, although a level of discretion is given to\nthe instructor, allowing the instuctor to determine the causes of plagiarism and\neffect other means of remedy. It is the obligation of the instructor to inform the\nstudent that a penalty is being assessed in such cases.\n\n \n\nCourse Policies\n\nAll homeworks are to be completed by each student individually. Lab assign-\nments are to be completed by the appropriate units (individual, pair, group),\nand no code/solution-sharing between units is permitted. Students are encour-\naged to discuss class content among themselves but NOT in a manner that con-\nstitutes plagiarism and cheating as defined above (e.g., you can solve together\na problem from the textbook that had not been assigned in the homework, but\nyou should solve assigned problems individually).\r'),

Many scholarly papers will be assigned for reading\nand discussion. Most papers will be available through the internet and digital libraries.\n\nSchedule\nThis course will meet Monday and Friday from 12:10 to 2pm in 14-232B.\n\nCourse Requirements\n\n1. Attendance and Participation\n\nStudents are expected to attend and actively participate in all course meetings and discussions, as\nwell as the course project. Readings will be assigned and must be completed prior to the class in\nwhich they are discussed. Readings will be posted on the course website schedule. Occasional\nquizzes may be given which will count towards the attendance/participation grade. More than\nthree absences for any reason will result in a zero for the attendance/participation grade.\n\n2. Technical Paper Presentations\n\nEach week we will select papers to be discussed in class from software engineering conferences\nand publications such as IEEE Software, IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, the\nInternational Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE), the IEEE Conference on\nRequirements Engineering, and the conference on Object Oriented Programming, Systems,\nLanguages, and Applications (OOPSLA). Although some papers will be selected by the\ninstructor, each student will also select a paper from an assigned issue/conference. These\nselections must be announced to the class one week prior to the date that the paper is to be\ndiscussed. All students are to read the selected papers, and the student who selected each one\nwill lead a discussion on the paper. Students will be graded on their summary of the salient\npoints of the paper, and effectiveness leading the class in a meaningful discussion of the paper.\n3. Current Events/Video Reviews\n\nEach student is expected to present two current events or video reviews in class. These can be\npresented on any day when we are discussing technical papers (not on days with mini-tutorials or\nguest speakers). Students should turn in a brief printed summary of the review at the time it is\npresented.\n\n4. Mini-Tutorial\n\nThis course will focus on software design and methods/tools/technologies for developing large\nsystems. Individually or in pairs, students will prepare a two-hour mini-tutorial on a particular\ntechnology, framework or tool. Example technologies include: Spring, Struts, Flex, Adobe Data\nServices, J2EE and EJB, .NET, Software Product Lines tools, xUnit, Aspect-Oriented\nProgramming, Service-Oriented Architectures, Model Driven Architecture tools, Alloy,\nArchitecture Description Languages, Object Constraint Language, iPhone, Android, etc.\nParticular emphasis should be placed on how the technologies exploit design patterns and\narchitectural styles. The tutorials should have a practical hands-on component for all\nparticipants. The tutorial will be graded on the presentation quality, the student’s mastery of the\nsubject, accurate characterization of design patterns and architectural styles, and the ability to\neffectively transfer knowledge to the class.\n\n5. Research Paper\n\nStudents will write a high-quality, publishable research paper. The topic should be consistent\nwith the topics of this course, but may incorporate the student’s other interests or research. The\npaper should target a particular software engineering conference, journal, or scholarly magazine,\nand should match the respective formatting guidelines. Failure to identify the target venue and\nmatch the formatting guidelines will result in a 15% grade reduction on the paper. You are not\nrequired to submit the paper for publication, but you are encouraged to do so. The goal is that\nyour paper is of publishable quality. Keep track of all contributors so you can properly\nacknowledge them if you do submit for publication. At a minimum, relatively short papers\n(around 5,000 words) could target high-quality magazines such as IEEE Software, IEEE\nComputer, or Communications of the ACM (around 2,500 words). Medium-length papers could\ntarget high-quality conferences such as OOPSLA (max 10,000 words) and ICSE (10 pages in\nICSE format). Longer papers could target high-quality journals such as “Transactions on\nSoftware Engineering” or “Empirical Software Engineering, An International Journal.” Such\npapers may be spread over the 508 and 509 courses, but a distinct deliverable must be provided\nin this course.\n\nThe following deadlines pertain to the research paper:\n4/13/09: Initial Paper Proposal and Presentation\n4/24/09: Structured Abstract & Bibliography\n\n5/11/09: Complete First Draft\n\n6/1/09: Final Paper\n\nFailure to meet an intermediate deadline will result in a 10% reduction in the final paper grade.\n6. Review Peer Work\n\nStudents will review each others’ papers at three points: verbal feedback will be given\ncollectively at the initial paper proposal presentations, written feedback of the first complete\ndraft will be given for two peers, and written feedback of the final draft will be given for two\npeers. The last stage of this process is meant to imitate a scholarly peer-review process.\n\nCommunication\n\nThe best place to discuss the course is during class meetings and office hours. All assignments\nand due dates will be announced in lecture and most, if not all, will be placed on the course web\nsite. Most class materials are available on the course web site; be sure to check regularly.\n\nEmail will only be used for special circumstances, such as communicating time sensitive\ninformation. You may email the instructor regarding personal issues only. If you use email, put\nCSC 509 on the subject line to get the best response time. All students are expected to have their\ncalpoly.edu and csc.calpoly.edu email accounts forward to wherever they will read email at least\ndaily. Leaving phone voicemails should be a last resort.\n\nClassroom Etiquette\n\nTo ensure a professional learning environment, the following rules will be enforced in the\n\nclassroom:\n\n¢ Do not eat except when food is provided for the entire class\n\n¢ Do not use electronic devices that make sounds (e.g. cell phones, ipods)\n\n¢ Do not use computers for anything besides presenting or taking notes when anyone is\npresenting (exceptions will be clearly announced, e.g. during project meeting times)\n\nGrading\n\nThe course grade will be determined on the following factors:\nClass Attendance and Participation (10%)\n\nTechnical Paper Presentations (10%)\n\nCurrent Events/Video Reviews (5%)\n\nResearch Paper (35%)\n\nMini-Tutorial (35%)\n\nPeer Paper Reviews (Draft, Final) (2.5% each)\n\nDAARYWND\n\nLetter grades will be assigned based on the expectation that an ‘A’ is earned with excellent work\non all aspects of the course, sustained throughout the course. A ‘B’ is earned with very good\nwork, perhaps excellent at times. A ‘C’ is earned with average work, perhaps very good at times\nbut poor at other times. A ‘D’ is earned with consistently poor work.\n\nClassroom Participation\n\nStudents are expected to take an active role in their own learning and the learning of their peers.\nStudents are expected to attend and be prepared for all lecture and lab sessions including reading\nall assigned sections prior to class. Lecture times will reflect this.\nLate Work Policies\n\nA software engineer has a responsibility to manage time effectively and turn in work on time.\nDeadlines are rarely absolute; if you are having a problem, discuss it as far in advance as\npossible. Failure to do so will result in a grade reduction.\n\nIntegrity\n\nAll work submitted is to be your own. Cooperative study and mutual aid are healthy learning\nmethods and are strongly encouraged. You are especially encouraged to build on the work of\nothers. Just cite sources of anything you have copied, summarized or discussed directly with\nanother. It is cheating to copy someone\'s work or allow someone to copy your work. It is\ncheating to copy material from a publication without giving credit. Plagiarism will result in a\ncourse grade of F. When you find good ideas by other people, the best policy is to summarize\nother work in your own words and cite their work as the source for the principle you state.\nCiting resources is not a sign of weakness of your own ideas, it is a sign that you can do research\nand build on others\' work.\r'),

While we rely on instructor’s lecture notes as much as\nwe rely on the content of the book, the book is extremely useful.\n\nTopics\n\nTopic Duration (weeks) | Material\n\n(weeks)\nAssociation Rules 1 Chapter 2 (Liu)\nSupervised Learning (Classification) Chapter 3 (Liu)\nUnsupervised Learning (Clustering) Chapter 4 (Liu)\nCollaborative Filtering Chapter 11, 12 (Liu)\nInformation Retrieval Chapter 6 (Liu)\nLink Analysis Chapter 7 (Liu)\nAdvanced Topics\n\n \n\n1.\n1.\n\n \n\n \n\nPlease note that the order in which these topics are covered may be different\nthan the order in which they are presented above.\nGrading\n\nLabs and Homeworks 60-70%\nProjects 30-40%\nCourse Policies\n\nPrerequisites\n\nThe official prerequistite for this course is CSC 349 (Algorithms). This prereq-\nuisite is enforced strictly. CSC 466 can be viewed as an advanced algorithms\ncourse for a certain important category of algorithms. Therefore, it is important\nthat the craft of algorithm design is not a mystery to anyone in the class.\n\nExams\n\nThe course will have no exams. In their stead you will be offered two take-\nhome group assignments. One assignment will ask you to apply the methods\nstudied in the course to exploratory analysis of some real-life data. The nature\nof the other assignment will be explained to you later in the course.\n\nWe may use the reserved final examination time for activities asso-\nciated with one, or both assignments. Additionally, depending on scheduling,\nyou may be required to participate in the CENG project fair at the end of the\nquarter presenting one or both projects you worked on in this class.\n\nLabs, Homeworks\n\nHands-on KDD-related activities are the core part of the course. Some activities\nwill be set up as lab exercises, some other activities may be offered as purely\ntake-home assignments (this will be determined by the pace of the course).\n\nEach lab/homework assignment will involve some data analysis task, that\nmay involve using existing software, software provided by the instructor as well\nas (and mostly) the software developed by you. The course concentrates on ba-\nsic algorithms for performing standard KDD tasks: the labs/assignments\ngive you an opportunity to cement the knoweldge of the algorithms covered in\nclass.\n\nWe will have pair programming, small team and individual assignments.\nEach lab/assignment will specify what type it is and how the pairs/teams are\nformed.\n\nNote: Machine learning, data mining and other KDD algorithms that we\nare going to study in the class are widely available, both as open source code\nand, in some cases, as methods/functions in popular KDD libraries. One of the\ngoals of this course is to have you implement these algorithms from\nscratch! The assignments will specify when you can, and when you cannot\nthird-party code/libraries to achieve the goals of the assignment.\n\nNote 2: At the same time, in a lot of the assignments, the main deliverable\nwill be not the code you write, but rather, the insight you obtain by running\nyour code on the data provided to you. Please be aware of that, as this shift in\nwhat is the main deliverable, is perhaps one of the key unique features of CSC\n466.\nLate Submissions\n\nLate lab and assignment submissions are strongly discouraged. The course\nwill run on a tight schedule, and not submitting on time will lead to time\ncarved out of the next assignment. A penalty of 10 - 30% will be assessed for\nany submissions that are late by less than 24 hours. No credit will be given\nfor any later submissions. You are encouraged to submit on time even if your\nsubmission it is not perfect. You can then resubmit a fixed version late, subject\nto the abovementioned rules. When more than one submission is present, we\nwill independently grade two submissions: (i) the latest on-time submission and\n(ii) the latest late submission for which non-zero credit can be assessed. Your\ngrade for the project will be the maximum of the two grades.\n\n \n\nCommunication\n\nThe class will have an official mailing list. The email address for the mailing\nlist is cpe-466-01-2184 @calpoly.edu. All students enrolled in the class are auto-\nmatically subscribed to the mailing list (using the email addresss that the CS\ndepartment has on file).\n\nI encourage questions during classtime and questions via email. My answers\nto email questions may be broadcast to the entire class via the mailing list, if the\nanswer may be relevant to everyone (e.g. a correction in a text of a handout,\nor a clarification of a homework problem), and may also appear on the web\npage. The questions can also be posted to the mailing list directly. The mailing\nlist will also be used for all annoucements related to the course. It is your\nresponsibility to read your class-related email. Failure to read email posted to\nthe mailing list cannot be used as an excuse in the class.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nWeb Page\nClass web page can be found at\nhttp: //www.csc.calpoly.edu/~dekhtyar/466-Spring2018\n\nThrough this page you will be able to access all class handouts including\nhomeworks, lab assignments, project information, lab/project data and lecture\nnotes.\n\nLinks to additional information, and notes and announcements will also be\nposted.\n\nAcademic Integrity\nUniversity Policies\nCal Poly’s Academic Integrity policies are found at\nhttp: //www.academicprograms.calpoly.edu/academicpolicies/Cheating.htm\n\nIn particular, these policies define cheating as (684.1)\n“... obtaining or attempting to obtain, or aiding another to obtain\ncredit for work, or any improvement in evaluation of performance, by\nany dishonest or deceptive means. Cheating includes, but is not lim-\nited to: lying; copying from another’s test or examination; discussion\nof answers or questions on an examination or test, unless such discus-\nsion is specifically authorized by the instructor; taking or receiving\ncopies of an exam without the permission of the instructor; using or\ndisplaying notes, ”cheat sheets,” or other information devices inap-\npropriate to the prescribed test conditions; allowing someone other\nthan the officially enrolled student to represent same.”\n\nPlagiarism, per University policies is defined as (684.3)\n\n“... the act of using the ideas or work of another person or persons\nas if they were one’s own without giving proper credit to the source.\nSuch an act is not plagiarism if it is ascertained that the ideas were\narrived through independent reasoning or logic or where the thought\nor idea is common knowledge. Acknowledgement of an original au-\nthor or source must be made through appropriate references; i.e.,\nquotation marks, footnotes, or commentary.”\n\nUniversity policies state (684.2): “Cheating requires an “F” course grade and\nfurther attendance in the course is prohibited.” (appeal proc s also outlined,\nsee the web site above for details.). Plagiarism, per university policies (684.4)\ncan be treated as a form of cheating, although a level of discretion is given to\nthe instructor, allowing the instuctor to determine the causes of plagiarism and\neffect other means of remedy. It is the obligation of the instructor to inform the\nstudent that a penalty is being assessed in such cases.\n\n \n\n \n\nCourse Policies\n\nAll homeworks are to be completed by each student individually. Lab assign-\nments are to be completed by the appropriate units (individual, pair, group),\nand no code/solution-sharing between units is permitted. Students are encour-\naged to discuss class content among themselves but NOT in a manner that con-\nstitutes plagiarism and cheating as defined above (e.g., you can solve together\na problem from the textbook that had not been assigned in the homework, but\nyou should solve assigned problems individually).\r'),

Using McMichael’s framework as a guide, we will follow chronologically various nations as\ntheir economies were shaped by global forces since World War II. In addition, we will read Kidder’s\nMountains Beyond Mountains for a better understanding of the social disconnect of the global north and global\nsouth. Along with carefully chosen articles, the readings will provide us with the foundation to do our own\ninvestigation of a single nation over time and bridge the incalculable wealth of “Wall Street” with the desperate\npoverty along the dirt roads of much of the world. We will close our class with a look at the present and future\nprojections about changing interactions between powerful economic actors and their hungry neighbors to the\nsouth.\n\nRequired Texts:\n1. Books\nTracy Kidder. 2003. Mountains Beyond Mountains. Random House.\n\n2. Articles\n\nReadings listed as “Polylearn” can be found on the course polylearn site.\n\nInstructions for accessing the site are as follows:\nFirst, log on to: www.mycalpoly.edu\nSearch for our course by name and number. You will not be able to log on unless you are formally\nregistered for the course.\n\nCourse Goals\n\nI have three main goals. The first is to use sociological tools to examine local and international issues/problems\nand illuminate the social forces that have shaped the current global political economy. Second, I want to\npromote a “critical consciousness” toward international development. Finally, through the course requirements\nI hope you will become a resident expert on one country and its ups and downs based on international changes\nin the marketplace.\n\nThe objectives for this course are for every student to:\n\n1. Demonstrate a comprehensive introductory understanding of key sociological concepts, terminology,\ntheories, approaches, and perspectives as they relate to political economy, globalization, and\ndevelopment.\n\n2. Apply sociological analysis to historical and current issues of the changing relationship of nations.\n\nImprove your ability to think critically and to articulate their ideas in written and verbal formats.\n4. Gain a broader understanding of the world, connecting macro-level processes to micro-level effects.\n\nw\nClass Procedure\n\nThis class will be pedagogically “mixed method.” Recognizing the various ways in which people learn,\nmy goal is to meet you the student half way in this learning process. Below are my commitments to you and\nexpectations of you as a student.\n\nFirst, my main teaching style is lecture mixed with class discussion and activities. Lecture will be\nconcise, relevant, and is central to the way this class is designed. Therefore, you are expected to be at every\nclass (unless you have an emergency) having read the designated material. A large percentage of your grade is\nbased on participation and the reading. Second, student presentations and discussions allow you to work\ntogether with other students to grapple with the material on a deeper level. Finally, the exams will give you the\nopportunity to show how brilliant you are. I expect that you not only understand concepts but that you can also\napply them to real life. My commitment is to judge your knowledge and effort as well as give you insightful\nfeedback on your work.\n\nCourse Requirements Percentage of the Final Grade:\nAssignments (4x 10% each) 40\nMidterm 25\nFinal 35\n\nAttendance, Participation, and Reading\n\nAs noted above, attendance is a necessary part of this class. Therefore, I will use quick-writes and group\nwork to check your attendance periodically.\n\nEveryone will be expected to participate. I have three goals in having students participate: to learn\nfrom one another, to be able to articulate clearly to others sociological theory via their experience, and to build\nconfidence in speaking their opinion publicly.\n\nReadings—do them. I have chosen to go for depth rather than breadth so time should not be an issue. I\nrecommend doing the reading and making notes in the margin, then going back later that day or the next day\nand reviewing the reading. This will help you “set” the information in your memory. These notes may also be\nuseful as a reference for later classes or work. Also, please bring the appropriate readings to class as they\nwill be referenced in lecture and group discussion.\n\n \n\nQuick Writes/Homework\n\nQuick writes are in-class writing exercises that will be used for various purposes. Sometimes they will be used\nas checks to make sure you are doing the reading and that you are prepared to discuss the reading in class. I\nwill also use them as a simple exercise to get your mind warmed up for a discussion. They must be legible if\nyou are to receive credit. I also may on occasion ask you to do a take home assignment. This work, along with\nyour quick writes, will be worth 20% of your grade.\n\nAssignments\nThroughout the course you will be asked to learn about your country and make a connection about what we are\n\nlearning to the political and economic development of that nation. These assignments will help you become\nresident experts on a nation and apply concepts to real events. Nations will be chosen by the first meeting of\nweek two.\n\nMidterm and Final Exam\n\nThe midterms and final exam will consist of true-false, multiple choice, and short-answer questions. The true-\nfalse and multiple choice questions will gauge your knowledge of key sociological terms, concepts, and theories\nwhile the short-answer questions will have you connect these ideas to real life situations.\nOther Issues\n\nCheating: I abhor efforts by students to turn in work that is not their own or to cheat the system in other ways.\nIn my classes I take an extra effort to make sure that this does not happen. If I find a student has cheated, I will\nmake sure the student is punished to the fullest extent by the Scholastic Conduct Committee. If you think that you\nmay do this, I recommend taking another class.\n\nLate and Make up policy: Tardiness is not accepted in other work environments and will not be accepted in this\nclass. Late homework and papers will not be accepted unless there is documented illness/other\nemergency. If it is an emergency, please see me individually. Homework will only be accepted as an upload\non polylearn.\n\nIncompletes: No incompletes will be given unless you have a prior written agreement with me and will only be\ngiven out in rare situations with extenuating circumstances present.\n\nClassroom Behavior: This is a college-level class. Therefore, I will treat you like adults. I expect you to\nparticipate often, engage the material both critically and constructively, and to the have the highest respect for\nothers, even if you disagree with what they say. We will have intellectual discussions, not petty arguments. It\nis my duty as an instructor to ensure that each student feels safe and respected when speaking in the classroom.\nDisruptive and disrespectful behavior will not be tolerated. If problems arise we will not spend class time\nsolving them. You will be asked to leave and we will work on a solution after class. Remember, both learning\nand teaching requires humility. Open yourself up to being changed.\n\n \n\nCellphones and Texting: I believe that talking on the phone or texting during class is disrespectful of the\nprofessor and of other students. Cellphones are therefore not allowed to be out during class. Period.\n\nComputers: Computers are an extremely important part of our society. Often, however, they can be a\nsignificant source of distraction. If I find students distracted by their use of computers, I will no longer permit\nstudents to use computers during class.\n\nEmail: The simplicity of writing emails, I believe, has encouraged students to email their professor at every\nwhim. I received dozens of emails last quarter in which the answer could have been found in the syllabus, from\na classmate, during class, or during office hours. Please only email me if it is critically urgent.\n\nDisabilities: It is University policy to provide, on a flexible and individualized basis, reasonable\naccommodations to students who have disabilities that may affect their ability to participate in course activities\nor to meet course requirements. I encourage you to contact me to discuss any individual needs for\naccommodations. The sooner you do the better.\n\nMedia/Speakers: I believe that technology and guest speakers are valuable tools to increase student learning.\nTherefore, various multimedia pieces will be used including movies, “You Tube” clips, speeches, and\ndocumentaries. These effects give life to the readings by showing real people and institutions being affected by\nrace, class and gender.\n\nDisclaimer: While I believe that it is important to treat the syllabus as a contract between us, I also reserve the\nright to make minor changes in the course as I see necessary. That said, I will do my best to maintain the\nsyllabus as-is and if changes need to be made, I will alert the class in a timely and appropriate manner.\nWHEN YOU ARE NOT SURE ABOUT SOMETHING OR HAVE A QUESTION:\nFirst re-read the syllabus\nThen check Polylearn\nThen check with a classmate\nThen wait until class or office hours\nThen, or if it is an emergency, please email me.\n\nWRWNP\nClass Schedule\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nWeek | Week | Readings (Tuesday) Readings (Thursday) Assignments or\nof: Tests (Thursday)\n1 Jan 7 | What is your perspective?

You will read these documents, and you will prepare and present\nyour assessment/critique of one of the theses.\n\nRelevant literature: you will be asked to prepare a bibliography of academic literature relevant to\nyour thesis/research topic. You will then be asked to read a number of papers from your\nbibliography.\n\nWriting Assignments:\n\nThe course will have the following writing assignments:\n\nResearch Blurb/Thesis Intro: you will write a succinct introduction to your research area. This\nintroduction should provide an overview of the broad research area within which you are\nconducting your thesis research and should motivate your specific thesis research. As such, this\ntext can be viewed as a draft of your thesis introduction section.\n\nExperimental design: you will come up with a validation framework for your thesis (creative part\nof the assignment) and present a short write-up describing it (writing part of the assignment).\nThis can eventually become part of the Validation section of your thesis.\n\nBackground/Related work writeup : based on your bibliography of related work you will provide\na succinct writeup detailing the background information relevant to your thesis research topic.\nThis may later morph into Related Work or Background sections of your thesis.\n\nOral Presentation Assignments\n\nYou will formally deliver two presentations in this course:\n\nShort presentation: A short (up to 5 mins) presentation describing the essence of your thesis\nresearch in terms accessible to your peers.\n\nLong(er) presentation: A longer (15-20 mins) presentation describing your thesis research in\nmore technical terms. This may serve as a prototype of your eventual thesis presentation.\n\nOther Assignments\n\nThere may be other assignments in the course:\n\n* M.S. Defense attendance. If any M.S. defenses are scheduled this quarter, we will attend them\n(ideally, I’d want everyone to attend 1-2 defenses).\n\nResearch talks by visiting researchers — you may be asked to attend various talks and to\nsummarize and critique them.\n\n* Peer reviews. Some class activities may involve peer reviews of material produced by others\n(e.g., past theses) or by other students in the course(e.g., their wiki submissions).\r'),

For logistical\nreasons, there are two sections of the course, one with Hunter as the instructor\nof record and one with Alex. Some of you are registered for Alex’s section, some\n— for Hunter’s.\n\nAll of you are in the SAME course.\n\nThis means that it makes no difference to the instructors, which section\nyou are in, and it will make no difference to you. Only one course is\ntaught. All requirements, expectations, assignments, grading, etc...\nare the same for all students taking this course.\n\nIf you need to discuss course material with the instructors, you can contact\neither of the us, regardless of who is listed as the instructor of record for your\nsection (in fact, the decisions on who to talk to probably will be based on the\nspecific complementary expertise of the instructors).\n\nOverview\n\nThis is the first quarter of a two-quarter Data Science capstone course. During\nthis course you will\n\ne Get assigned to a project team\ne Work with the project customer to outline the project requirements\n\ne Design a variety of solutions appropriate to the problem(s) your team will\nbe studying\n\ne Begin implementing your solutions\ne Write a progress report and give a mid-project presentation in class\ne Work on a number of assignments designed to improve your writing\n\ne Recieve some additional instruction on machine learning techniques not\ncovered in DATA 401.\n\nWe have six hours of contact time/week. This time is broken down as follows:\n\nTeam meetings: 2.5 hours\nMeeting with instructors/client: 0.5 hours\nLecture: 1 hour\nWriting assignments/discussion: 1 hour\nMiscellenious activities: 1 hour\n\nStarting Week 2, each team will have a specific time slot for meetings with\ncustomer /instructors (even weeks - customer meeting, odd weeks - meeting with\ninstructors w/o customers).\n\nTexbook and Literature\n\nThe official textbook for the course is\n\nJoseph M. Williams and Joseph Bizup. Style: Lessons in Clarity\nand Grace. (Any edition is fine.) Pearson, 2016.\n\nPlease go ahead and buy this book on-line as soon as possible, as the\nfirst assignment will come at the end of week 1 of the class.\n\nTopics and Tentative Schedule\n\nTable 1 contains the tentative schedule for the course. Please note, that oral\npresentations will take place during Week 10 of classes. There are no in-person\nmeetings/presentations scheduled for the finals week, however, your written re-\nports will be due some time during the finals week.\n\nGrading\n\nYour overall grade will be calculated according to the following weighting scheme.\nWeekly Progress Reports 20%\nEnd-Quarter Presentation 20%\n\nEnd-Quarter Report 20%\nPeer Assessment 20%\nAssignments 20%\nWeek Activity\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n1 Introduction, Project Presenations\n\n2 Team formation, initial meetings\n\n3-5 Requirements, Data Collection, Feature Engineering\n\n6-9 Initial analysis\n\n10 Report and presentation preparation, Mid-project presentations\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFinals week | Report due\n\nTable 1: Tentative schedule for the course.\n\nCourse Participation expectations\n\nWe expect everyone to actively participate in the work on the team projects.\nYour level of contribution to your teams will be reflected in your course partici-\npation grade as well. To this end, we will conduct post-project peer assessments,\nwhere contributions of each person will be peer-reviewed by their teammates.\n\nCommunication\n\nBecause there are two sections, Dr. Glanz does not have the ability to e-mail\nstudents in Dr. Dekhtyar’s section, nor does Dr. Dekhtyar have the ability to\ne-mail students in Dr. Glanz’s. To make communication easier, we will post all\nannouncements on the Piazza forum.\n\nIf sending questions to the instructors, we encourage you to address the\nquestions to both of us. One of the instructors may have a better insight than\nthe other into a specific issue you might have, although at times, collective\nwisdom of both instructors will yield a much better answer than individual\nresponses would have. Additionally, both instructors would want to know what\ninquiries are made, and how they were responded to.\n\nWeb Page\nClass web page can be found at\nhttp: //www.csc.calpoly.edu/~dekhtyar/DATA451-Winter2019\n\nThrough this page you will be able to access all class handouts including\nhomeworks, project information and lecture notes. Despite the URL, the web\npage will be maintained by both instructors.\n\nAcademic Integrity\n\nUniversity Policies\n\nCal Poly’s Academic Integrity policies are found at\nhttp: //www.academicprograms.calpoly.edu/academicpolicies/Cheating.htm\nIn particular, these policies define cheating as (684.1)\n\n“... obtaining or attempting to obtain, or aiding another to obtain\ncredit for work, or any improvement in evaluation of performance, by\nany dishonest or deceptive means. Cheating includes, but is not lim-\nited to: lying; copying from another’s test or examination; discussion\nof answers or questions on an examination or test, unless such discus-\nsion is specifically authorized by the instructor; taking or receiving\ncopies of an exam without the permission of the instructor; using or\ndisplaying notes, ”cheat sheets,” or other information devices inap-\npropriate to the prescribed test conditions; allowing someone other\nthan the officially enrolled student to represent same.”\nPlagiarism, per University policies is defined as (684.3)\n\n“... the act of using the ideas or work of another person or persons\nas if they were one’s own without giving proper credit to the source.\nSuch an act is not plagiarism if it is ascertained that the ideas were\narrived through independent reasoning or logic or where the thought\nor idea is common knowledge. Acknowledgement of an original au-\nthor or source must be made through appropriate references; i.e.,\nquotation marks, footnotes, or commentary.”\n\nUniversity policies state (684.2): “Cheating requires an “F” course grade and\nfurther attendance in the course is prohibited.” (appeal process is also outlined,\nsee the web site above for details.). Plagiarism, per university policies (684.4)\ncan be treated as a form of cheating, although a level of discretion is given to\nthe instructor, allowing the instuctor to determine the causes of plagiarism and\neffect other means of remedy. It is the obligation of the instructor to inform the\nstudent that a penalty is being assessed in such cases.\n\n \n     \n\nCourse Policies\n\nWork. Individual work is to be completed by individual students. Team\nprojects are to be completed by the combined team. No people outside the class\nshall be involved in completing any assignments. Some level of consultation be-\ntween students in the class on team projects (and on some of the individual\nassignments) is permitted, but all work claimed on project reports and in other\ndeliverables must be completed by the team itself, and any substantative con-\ntributions of classmates from other teams! must be explicitly acknowledged in\nall writeups in this class.\n\nCode sharing and Licensing Compliance. Use of third-party libraries for\ndata analysis, visualizations, and other tasks (data cleaning, e.g.) is generally\npermitted, subject to the appropriateness of the licensing terms to the partic-\nulars of the project”. Similarly, your data acquisition efforts must conform to\nany explicit rules and limitations set forth by the data owner(s).\n\nIn all cases where you are not sure how to proceed, PLEASE CONSULT\nTHE INSTRUCTORS!\n\nCitations. In all written work, please follow the standards of proper academic\ncitations. All submitted papers must feature full bibliography containing all ref-\nerences cited in the both of the submission. Direct quotes from academic and\nnon-academic sources must be represented explicitly as quotes in your submis-\nsions, and must be properly attributed. Failure to do so will be considered an\ninstance of plagiarism.\n\n1For example, if a member of another team helped you brainstorm the architecture of a\nneural network, or if your team used a data parsing tool built by another team and shared\nwith yours.\n\n°E.g., GPL-licensed tools cannot be used for a product that your customer may want for\ncommercial use, although they can be used for non-commercial prototypes.\r'),

Lab descriptions are found on my website. Read them\nbefore coming to lab class.\n\nGroup Lab Reports:\n\nEach group is expected to turn in one lab report at the end of lab. Each week one member of the\ngroup is to submit the “group” report. Group members are expected to rotate the duties of writing\nthe group lab report so every student has submitted at least two group reports.\n\nLab reports should be typed in class on Word, but it is acceptable to hand-write equations,\n\ndiagrams and other aspects of the report after printing. Use the active past tense for all your writing\n(e.g. “We measured the period of a pendulum for five different lengths”). Plots of data and analysis\nof data (primarily using a linear fit) should be accomplished on Excel. Plots can be copied and\npasted into your Word document. You do not need to print the Excel spreadsheet with all your data\nfor your lab report.\n\nThe report should contain the following sections:\n\n1. Title\n\n2. Names of all group members. The name of the student who is writing the group lab report\nshould be circled.\n\n3. Abstract: Leave a few lines blank and fill this section in at the end when you know what you\ndid. In the abstract state the aim(s) of the experiment, briefly describe the experiment, and\nstate your results in a single paragraph. In every experiment we test a physics equation or\n“model” to see if it accurately describes experimental measurements. Your abstract should\nstate what this physics model is, and if the model quantitatively predicted your experiment\nwell (or not and how it failed) based on your error analysis (see section 6).\n\n4. Data plots and tables: Include plots of data collected in the experiments along with fits to\nthe data and the fit line equation shown in the plot. Plots in Excel should be pasted into\nthe document and should include axis labels with units. Include a table of any measurements\nthat were not plotted.\n\n5. Questions: Answer the follow-up questions using complete sentences. You won’t get full\ncredit unless you show your work for all calculations.\n\n6. Measurement uncertainties and sources of error: List an estimate of the uncertainty for\neach data measurement in the form “+ 1 mm” based on the actual accuracy of the\nmeasurement. If there is difficulty determining the measurement uncertainty, such as the\ntiming of clicking a stop watch, include this description in your estimate of the uncertainty.\nDetermine the accuracy of the physics model to predict the data using a percent difference\nbetween your data and the model, usually determined from the data fit line equation. Did\nthe physics model describe the experiment well? Include your verdict in your Abstract\nbased on your actual measurements and percent difference. List the sources of error that the\nphysics model did not include (e.g. friction, air resistance, etc.). (Never use the words\n“human error.” Instead say something specific like “the accuracy of our length\nmeasurements was limited by our ability to determine the location of the center of mass of\nthe weight.”) Finally, comment on ways to improve your experimental results.\nPHYSICS 132 Laboratory Syllabus 2\nWinter 2019\n\nBefore you disassemble your experiment and delete the data on the lab computer, please let me\ncheck your report for obvious mistakes. This will help me help you get a better grade.\n\nGrading: Lab report and lab recitation grades will be graded on a scale of 0 to 10.\nYour grade in this lab depends equally on the scores from the reports that you write and the\nscores of the reports that your lab partners write. The total lab grade accumulated at the end\nof the quarter will be sent to your lecture instructor to be included in your course grade.\n\nPhysics Laboratory Policies:\n\nSafety\n\ne Do not eat or drink in the classroom.\n\ne Make sure you understand and follow directions for each experiment, including the safety\ndirections.\n\ne Ifyou injure yourself -- for example, if you cut yourself - tell your instructor at once.\n\ne Donot perform unauthorized experiments.\n\nEquipment\n\ne Donot use any equipment not explicitly required for the experiment.\n\ne If any equipment is broken or not functioning correctly inform you instructor immediately.\ne When in doubt, ask!\r'),

In\nplain English -- it was a dumb idea.\n\nI’ve spent a few days experimenting with Python/QT and Java/Swing as possible alternatives to the current\nJava/GWT implementation. Neither of the alternative platforms is a panacea for the problems with the current\nimplementation.\n\nIt is clear now that the approach most likely to produce a usable product is to focus clearly on fixing the problems in\nthe existing code, fully test the entire system, and release as soon as possible for client review. We will discuss this\napproach on the first day of class.\n\nAccepting the Rethink\n\nPer consensus on the first day of class, we have agreed to indeed proceed with the current implementation. Accord-\ningly, the following items need to be accomplished before we release to the clients:\n\n1. the immediate bugs must be fixed, and we must all redo the delayed user-level acceptance testing for each\ndepartment\n\n2. every model method must have a JUnit test, and it must pass it\n\n3. every GWT screen must have a Selenium test, and it must pass it\n\n4. the end-user acceptance tests must pass for all departments to which a release is made\n5.\n\nall user-critical Jira issues must be resolved\n\nDuring 405, we were building a prototype that was not fully tested, which we could have released as such to under-\nstanding clients. Having not produced a prototype suitable for release, we have now entered the deployment phase,\nwhere any released product must be fully tested.\n\nFixing Immediate Bugs\n\nThere are some acceptance test results from 405. Mine in particular itemize specific bugs that must be fixed imme-\ndiately, so we can have another round of customer-level acceptance testing. See\nhttp://scheduler.csc.calpoly.edu/releases/alpha/testing/acceptance/CSC/\nfinals-week-report.html\n\nIn particular, all of the MAJOR ERRORs must be fixed.\n\nThe immediate point of user-level acceptance testing is to ensure that the functionality we now have in place is ade-\nquate to allow real department schedules to be generated. That is, we need to make sure that there are no significant\nuser-level features that make it difficult or impossible to produce department schedules, in particular for Fall 2011\nand Winter 2012. This level of human acceptance testing will go on in parallel with the code-level JUnit and Sele-\nnium testing.\n\nAdministrative Process\n\nThe following is the administrative process we will follow, as discussed during the 405 final exam period, and\nrefined during the first class meeting of 406:\n\n* Daily on-time attendance is mandatory, except for\nPage 2\n\noJames and Tyler H pre-approved class conflicts\noJake for the first four weeks, who has a pre-approved absence request\nooccasional critical absences, for which advance notification is required\n\nomedical family emergencies\n\n¢ We will work in two-person teams, as described below under the heading \"Team Pairings and Meta Pairings\"\n* We will conduct weekly code reviews, as described below under the heading \"Code Review Process\" and\n\"Code Review Criteria\".\n\nOn Mondays and Fridays, up to 10 minutes at the beginning of class will be devoted to a Scrum-style stand-up dis-\ncussion of issues of potential relevance to the entire class. If no such issues exist, then no discussion will be neces-\nsary.\n\nAfter the first two days of class, all class and lab time will be devoted to working on the project. Think of this as a\njob where you come to the office six hours per week to do work.\n\nTeam Pairings and Meta Pairings\n\nThe following is the tentative team organization we agreed to during the 405 final exam period:\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTeam Project Focus Code Review Pairing\nSalome, Adam Algorithm Schedule Views\nMatt, Tyler Y Schedule Views Algorithm\n\nKaylene, Jonathan | Resource Tables, Back End Front End\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nEvan, Tyler H Resource Tables, Front End Back End\nJake, Carsten Instructor Web App Top-Level\nJames, Jordan Top-Level UI & File Storage | Instructor Web App\n\n \n\nThe ’Code Review Paring’ column indicates how the teams are paired for the code review process. Teams so paired\nwill review each other’s code.\n\nCode Review Process\nThe following is the code review process we tentatively agreed to during the 405 final exam period:\n* Code reviews are scheduled weekly.\n* Commit by 1PM Monday.\n* Review by 11AM Wednesday.\n* Reviewers and reviewees communicate as necessary outside of class, including meetings to go over review\n\nresults.\n\nThe code to review is any file for which one or more svn diffs exist since the commit for the previous week’s review.\nThere will be a script that will perform the diffs and list the files that need to be reviewed in a particular week.\n\nCode Review Criteria\n\nThe following are the code review criteria we tentatively agreed to during the 405 final exam period, and refined dur-\ning the first week of 406:\nPage 3\n\n* follows standards posted on 406 web page\n* it has good Javadoc\n* it has a sensible design\n\n* it has sensible execution, including passing tests\n\nSystem and Acceptance Test Procedures\n\nThe following acceptance test procedure was determined during Wednesday of Week 2 of class:\n« James releases to department sites once per week only at 12:55PM Mondays.\n\n¢ Fisher and two other 406 members will perform department-specific acceptance testing on deployment sites\nby Friday at 11AM.\n\n* Particularly noteworthy acceptance test results will be reported to the Friday stand-up\n\n* It is critical for the first three weeks of acceptance testing to identify any missing essential program features,\ni.e., features that make it difficult or impossible to generate specific department schedules.\n\nProcess Details to Be Discussed and Resolved\n\nThe following matters will be discussed and resolved in the first two class meetings of Spring quarter:\n* revised repo structure; as of Wednesday 28 March a revised repo is in place, thanks to Evan\n\n* confirmation of team pairings; as of Wednesday 28 March the team structure in the preceding table has been\nconfirmed by all\n\n* precise schedule for code reviews; as of Wednesday 28 March the code review process and criteria in the pre-\nceding tables have been confirmed by all\n\n* exact definition of regression testing and repository commit process, including review of test/commit script,\nwhich does the following;\n\norun regression test suite, which includes coverage tests\nosvn commit if all tests pass\n\nAs of Wednesday 28 March the regression test policy is to redirect JUnit stderr output to a log file, with an\nempty log file indicating that regression tests have all passed; this policy has been confirmed by a majority of\nclass members, and will be fully confiredm on Monday 2 April\n\nSchedule\n\nBased on dicussions during the second class meeting, the following is the large-grain confirmed project schedule:\nWeek = Task\n\n \n\n1 Wednesday: Project planning is complete\n2 Monday: Some 405 bugs fixed, minimum 25% tested\n3 Monday: All 405 bugs fixed, minimum 50% tested\n4 Monday: Minimum 75% tested\n5 Monday: 100% tested\n\nWednesday: Contacted interested clients\n\nFriday: Released to clients\n\n6 Add enhancements, respond to client feedback\n\n7 Add enhancements, respond to client feedback\n\n8 Second client release, work on documentation\n\n9 Respond to client feedback, work on documentation\n10 Work on documentation, final client release\n\n \n\n \n\nPage 4\n\nThe percentage measurements for testing is based on code coverage.

The first\nthing | want to mention is that it is pretty important to join the right zoom meeting. During class time, the zoom link differs\nfrom the Office Hours link. Second, this class is a “synchronous” class for a variety of reasons. We\'ll typically start the class\nsession off with QnA, then a brief lecture or discussion on the topic of the day. Following that, you will be working on a lab\nactivity together with other students in zoom breakout groups. You will need a machine with a web browser at least. We\nwill then typically wrap up at the end of the classtime with a discussion. | do have some virtual meetings that will conflict\nwith office hours or some of class on some days. | will announce those in advance and depending on the situation, we will\nmake alternate arrangements. All exams will be open-book and open notes. All exams will be given during a time-window\nthat will allow some flexibility.\n\nGeneral Information: To do well in this course you should focus on the concepts, not just on equations or how to “get it\ndone” via software. Fortunately, the concepts that we cover are somewhat familiar to most of you because you see them\nevery day in the news and in your other classes. The main goal of this class is to help you understand these concepts more\nthoroughly and the way we do this is by presenting these everyday concepts in a more formal fashion. However, this is\noften quite difficult for several reasons. First, we need to understand the language of probability and statistics then we\nneed to use that language. To achieve this goal each student needs to take on certain responsibilities. During class\nsessions we will be unpacking the more important and more challenging portions of the course material on a daily basis, so\ntwo of the student’s responsibilities are to be in class and to participate in any class discussions. Another responsibility the\nstudent must take on is reading the book and working homework exercises in a timely fashion.\n\nYou are encouraged to work with others on the homework assignments, but you will need to turn in your own work. (Put\nthings in your own words even if your equations match those of your buddy.)\n\n| believe that the timed midterm exams are often difficult, but to make up for that, | award partial credit (as appropriate)\nand also remember the difficulty of the exams when assigning final course grades. While it may be the case that, due to the\ndifficulty of the exams, | will adjust this grading scale downwards, someone who achieves 89% of the possible points will\nearn at least an A-. (Similarly, 79% — B-, 69% —>C-.)\n\nLate assignments will not be accepted. There are no late or “make-up” exams. If you are ill, we’ll work something out. If\nyou know of a reason in advance you will be unable to reasonably get something done, let me know in advance.\n\nSoftware: JMP and/or Minitab (both are available to you as a student for free, bout for download and inside the new\n“virtual machine” that Cal Poly has developed for this quarter (it operates inside a browser window).\n\nTexts: Modern Statistics for the Life Sciences by Grafen and Hails (Required), Statistical Sleuth (3) by Ramsey and Schafer\n(Recommend), and An Introduction to Statistical Methods and Data Analysis (6\"\") by Ott and Longnecker (Recommended)\nGrading Information: Your grade will be based on the following numerical score:\n\n \n\nOption Option What When Additional Information\n1 2\n17% 17% Homework Weekly Due Mondays at 11:59pm\n11% 11% Labs About two per week Due before the next class starts\n18% 24% Exam 1 Thu, April 23 Covers through Chapter 3\n18% 24% Exam 2 Tue, May 18 Covers Chapters 4-9\n36% 24% Final Exam Tue, June 9 1-hour or 3-hour test\n100% 100%\n\n| suspect that students who are doing well before the final exam will choose Grading Option 2 which essentially is like 3\n\nexams, the final covering only material discussed after Exam 2.\n\nOn the other hand, students who want to improve their grade after the 2\" exam can more easily do so by putting more\nweight on a comprehensive final exam that is twice as long as a midterm (but you will have 3 hours to do the test).\n\nTentative Schedule\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nWeek Dates Tuesday Thursday Other\n1 Mar 30-Apr 3 No Class No Class\n2 Apr 6-10 Administrivia/T-test/Cl Ch 1/ANOVA\n3 Apr 13-17 Ch 1/ANOVA Ch 2/Regression\n4 Apr 20-24 Che 3/ GLMs Review/Exam Exam\n5 Apr 27-May 1 Ch 4/Multiple X’s Ch 4/Multiple X’s t Ch 5 on your\nown\n6 May 4-May 8 Ch 6/Quant and Cat X’s Ch 7/Interactions §\n7 May 11-May 15 | Ch 8/Checking | Ch 9/Checking II/Review\n8 May 18-May 22 | Review/Exam Ch 10/Variable Selection Exam\n9 May 25-May 29 | Ch 11/Model Selection Logistic Regression\n10 June 1-Jun 5 Ch 12/Random Effects t Review\n\n \n\n \n\n+ —Cal Poly Corporation Meeting — | will be there for part of class but not all of class\n§ — Academic Senate of the CSU — | will be there for part of class but not all of class\n\nStatistics 513\n\nSteve Rein\r'),

Whether working for public\n(government) or private sector enterprises, a successful business manager must possess the ability to\nunderstand and critically analyze socioeconomic and business information. This course introduces\nstudents to sources and methods of collecting and interpreting accounting, economic and financial\ninformation that are critical to business managers\' ability to analyze a company, and create value for\ntheir organization. The pertinent information include various regulatory financial statements (e.g., forms\n10-K, 10-Q), micro- and macro-economic data (e.g., GDP, CPI, consumer sentiment surveys), analysts\nreports (e.g., buy and sell side reports), and business and financial press (e.g., Wall Street Journal,\nBloomberg). Students will develop comprehensive insights on how financial and socioeconomic\ninformation are related in addressing and meeting the needs of various organizational stakeholders (e.g.,\naccounting, finance, marketing departments). Students will learn how to evaluate these varied\ninformation that affect all business enterprises, with an emphasis on the uses of financial statements by\nbusiness managers and persons outside the firm, such as investors, creditors and financial analysts.\nCATALOG DESCRIPTION\n\nSelected economic problems analyzed at an advanced level in a particular field, such as international\ntrade, public finance, urban, industrial organization or transportation.\n\nCOURSE METHODS\n\nThe course involves a combination of teaching and learning methods:\n\nReadings of book chapters to preview concepts and establish advanced terminology\nShort lectures to review specific concepts and the toolbox of analyzing companies\nIn class problems to be solved using spreadsheet modeling\n\nClass presentations on economic and financial indicators that matter to a business\nA midterm and a final exam that are essentially related to your project\n\nwARWNP\n\nTEXT and MATERIALS\n\nAll course materials and textbooks are available either via PolyLearn or online.\n\nRequired Textbook\n\nGuide to Economic Indicators (GET), 6\" edition, The Economist, John Wiley & Sons, 2005\n\nGuide to Financial Markets (GFM), 4\" edition, The Economist, John Wiley & Sons, 2006\n\nCorporate Finance by Ivo Welch, 3“ Edition, 2014 (available online and in print)\n\nGuide to Analyzing Companies (GAC), 4 edition, The Economist, John Wiley & Sons, 2005\nStrategic Risk Taking: a Framework for Risk Management by Damodaran, Aswath, Pearson Prentice\nHall, 2007, Link\n\n \n\nRecommended Textbooks\nGuide to Business Modelling (GBM), 2\" edition, The Economist, John Wiley & Sons, 2005\nUsing Excel for Principles of Econometrics (EPE), 3\" edition, Ogune & Hill, John Wiley & Sons, 2008\n\nOther Readings\nI also strongly recommend that you subscribe to a financial newspaper such as the Wall Street Journal\n\nand its CFO Journal section.

If you are new to Excel please make sure you watch the\nintroductory videos posted on PolyLearn before the first session.\n¢ A financial calculator may come handy at times.\n\nCLASS PRESENTATION\n\nEach student is supposed to present an assigned chapter of mainly the two text books: Guide to Economic\nIndicators (GED), and Guide to Financial Markets (GFM). You will choose the chapter that you would like\nto present via PolyLearn on a first come first served basis. You will have 30 minutes to present the chapter\nand discuss (1) how the special economic or financial indicator or instrument matter to a business, and (2)\nwhere to collect up to date data on it. The presentation will follow by a discussion that goes beyond the\nchapter content. Here is your chance to earn decent participation points by bring additional material related\nto the chapter into the class. For further information on presentation please refer to the Presentation\nHandout.\nFINAL PROJECT\n\nAs an application of the skills learned in the course you will build a detailed company analysis and\nvaluation report as the course progresses. In here, you choose a publicly traded firm and perform a thorough\nvaluation analysis, and make investment recommendations.\n\nGRADING POLICY\n\nClass Participation 10%\nClass Presentation 20%\nQuizzes 20%\nMidterm Exam (including the first project report) 25%\nFinal Exam (including the second project report) 25%\nCLASS ATTENDANCE\n\nI strongly encourage you to attend all classes and actively participate in class discussions. You should\nbring a name card to class. I may not formally take attendance every session but tend to remember faces\nand names. If you are repeatedly absent from classes it will materially affect your grade. If you miss a\nclass, it is your responsibility to check with a classmate on what took place during that class. Use of\ncomputers, laptops, tablets, and smart phones is not generally allowed in this class unless it is authorized\nby the instructor.\n\nCOMMUNICATION PROTOCOL\n\nAll submissions for the assignments must be done online via the PolyLearn. The primary method of\ncommunication will be PolyLearn and office hours. NO EMAILS PLEASE (unless it concerns a personal\nmatter). I will post all information and announcements on PolyLearn.

Because of this,\nthe traditional 90-A, 80-B, 70-C grading schema does not work in my classes.\nHistorically, the A/B cutoff has been around 80-85%, while the B/C cutoff has\nbeen around 70%.\n\nCourse Policies\n\nExams\n\nThe course will involve a lot of project-related activities during the Finals week,\ntherefore, we will not have a final exam (which would otherwise have to take\nplace on Friday).\n\nInstead, there will be two midterm exams scheduled for the following dates:\n\n1. Midterm 1: (tentative date) Monday, February 12 (or any other class\nduring Week 6).\n2. Midterm 2: Friday, March 16.\n\nNote: Because there is a one-hour break between lecture and lab, each midterm\nexam will be split into two parts, each part designed to take 50 minutes to com-\nplete. You will receive part 1 of the midterms during the lecture portion of the\nclass, and will submit them (for good) at the end of the lecture. You will receive\npart 2 of each exam in the lab. I understand that this is inconvenient, but this\nis probably the best we can do. Our other alternative is to switch to four 50-min\nquizzes throughout the quarter.\n\nMake-up exams will not be given, unless there are extraordinary circum-\nstances present and I am notified in advance. The policy regarding the use of\ntextbooks and notes will be announced at least one week prior to each exam.\n(Typically, I allow a single cheat sheet on all my exams).\n\nLabs and project\n\nPractical knowledge of the database modeling techniques and practical experi-\nence in building database applications will be conveyed through labs and the\ncourse project.\n\nLab 1 is designed to test your knowledge of SQL. Unlike previous years,\nwhere Lab 1 was administered more as a quiz, this time Lab 1 is a week-long\nlab.\n\nLabs 2 — 5 are design labs for the course project (see below). These labs will\nrun through the end of Week 6 of the course.\n\nDuring the last four weeks of the quarter, additional standalone labs will be\ngiven on occasion to provide hands-on experience with non-relational database\ndesign and with the work of non-relational DBMS. In parallel with the stan-\ndalone labs you will be working in your teams on the project — some of the lab\nperiods will be dedicated to team work and meeting with the customer.\n\nEach lab assignment will span 2-4 lab sessions. Each lab assignment is due\nby the end of lab period on the due date (unless specified otherwise). You are\nwelcome to work on the lab assignments outside the lab hours, however, lab\nperiod attendance is mandatory. Project-related lab assignments will be\ndone in groups formed at the beginning of the course. Standalone lab assign-\nments will either be individual or group — this will be stated on each assignment\nexplicitly.\n\nProject. This course will involve a quarter-long team project which will re-\nquire each team to go through all the steps of database application modeling,\ndesign and implementation. The project will have an outside customer, and the\ngoal of the project is to produce a working, usable prototype of the database\napplication, which the customer can adopt, further extend and enhance after\nthe delivery. At the beginning of the quarter, you will have opportunities to\ninteract with the customer and learn about the application desiderata (require-\nments) from him. Throughout the course, you will have opportunity to consult\nthe customer. This should allow you to fine-tune your application design to the\ncustomer needs.\n\nThis year, we have one customer, and generally speaking, all teams will\nbe working on the same project. However I reserve the right to individualize\nthe assignments of different groups. The specifical individualizations may in-\nvolve language of implementation, added stress on certain features, or certain\ncategories of users, use of advanced database modeling techniques, or imple-\nmentation of additional use cases.\n\nNote: Due to my travel schedule and the travel schedule of the customer, the\ninitial presentation of the project will take place about one week later (Wednes-\nday, January 17) than it typically would. This will not be detrimental to the\nproject, and in fact, may allow you to make fewer initial errors in designing the\ncustomer’s database.\n\nHomeworks\n\nIn addition to labs, a number of paper-and-pencil homeworks will be assigned.\nHomeworks will typically consist of problems taken from database textbooks,\nor similarly styled problems. The primary purpose of the paper-and-pencil\nhomeworks is preparation for exams. Not all homeworks (or not all problems\nin a given homework) may end up being graded.\n\nLate Submissions\n\nAll assignments, unless stated otherwise, are due at classtime on the due date:\nhomeworks - at the beginning of the class (with grace period extending to the\nbeginning of the lab period); lab assignments - at the end of the lab period. Any\ndeviations from these rules will be spelled out explicitly in the assignments.\n\nHomework/lab assignments submitted later than indicated above will be\nconsidered late submissions.\n\nIf paper-and-pencil homework solutions are distributed on the due date of\nthe homework, late homework submissions will not be accepted. Oth-\nerwise, late homeworks can be submitted during next 24 hours for a 10-30%\npenalty (the exact amount will depend on the submission time and the specific\ncircumstances). No homework submissions will be accepted afterwards.\n\nLate lab assignment submissions can be turned in before or at the beginning\nof the next lab period for a 10-30% penalty (the exact amount will depend\non the submission time and the specific cireumstances\'). No lab assignment\nsubmissions will be accepted after that.\n\n \n\nCommunication\nThe class has the following official mailing list\n\n1The penalty will be larger if the gap between the two lab periods includes a weekend and\nsmaller otherwise\ncsc-366-01-2182@calpoly.edu\n\nI encourage questions during classtime and questions via email. My answers\nto email questions may be broadcast to the entire class via the mailing list, if the\nanswer may be relevant to everyone (e.g. a correction in a text of a handout,\nor a clarification of a homework problem), and may also appear on the web\npage. The questions can also be posted to the mailing list directly. The mailing\nlist will also be used for all annoucements related to the course. It is your\nresponsibility to read your class-related email. Failure to read email posted to\ncs405001 mailing list cannot be used as an excuse in the class.\n\nWeb Page\nClass web page can be found at\nhttp: //www.csc.calpoly.edu/~dekhtyar/366-Winter2018/\n\nThrough this page you will be able to access all class handouts including home-\nworks, project information and lecture notes.\n\nAcademic Integrity\n\nUniversity Policies\n\nCal Poly’s Academic Integrity policies are found at\nhttp: //www.academicprograms.calpoly.edu/academicpolicies/Cheating.htm\nIn particular, these policies define cheating as (684.1)\n\n“... obtaining or attempting to obtain, or aiding another to obtain\ncredit for work, or any improvement in evaluation of performance, by\nany dishonest or deceptive means. Cheating includes, but is not lim-\nited to: lying; copying from another’s test or examination; discussion\nof answers or questions on an examination or test, unless such discus-\nsion is specifically authorized by the instructor; taking or receiving\ncopies of an exam without the permission of the instructor; using or\ndisplaying notes, ”cheat sheets,” or other information devices inap-\npropriate to the prescribed test conditions; allowing someone other\nthan the officially enrolled student to represent same.”\n\nPlagiarism, per University policies is defined as (684.3)\n\n“... the act of using the ideas or work of another person or persons\nas if they were one’s own without giving proper credit to the source.\nSuch an act is not plagiarism if it is ascertained that the ideas were\narrived through independent reasoning or logic or where the thought\nor idea is common knowledge. Acknowledgement of an original au-\nthor or source must be made through appropriate references; i.e.,\nquotation marks, footnotes, or commentary.”\n\non\nUniversity policies state (684.2): “Cheating requires an “F” course grade and\nfurther attendance in the course is prohibited.” (appeal process is also outlined,\nsee the web site above for details.). Plagiarism, per university policies (684.4)\ncan be treated as a form of cheating, although a level of discretion is given to\nthe instructor, allowing the instuctor to determine the causes of plagiarism and\neffect other means of remedy. It is the obligation of the instructor to inform the\nstudent that a penalty is being assessed in such cases.\n\nCourse Policies\n\nAll homeworks are to be completed by each student individually.

All members\nof this class are expected to contribute to a respectful, welcoming, and inclusive environment for every other\nmember of the class.\n\nThere is an old adage that encourages those with questions to ask because others may have the same question;\nyou do not need some imagined quorum in order to validate your question or your request for assistance. If you\nhave a question or need assistance, that alone is sufficient. You belong here and your participation in the course\nis not only welcomed but encouraged.\n\nPersonal Well-being\n\nThere are times when coursework and non-academic obligations may conflate to create a seemingly unbearable\nsituation. During these times, your coursework may suffer and you may opt to not complete a milestone by the\nposted date; I understand this and you need not apologize for it. If this happens, do not get discouraged. The\ncourse is structured such that you can choose the milestones on which you wish to focus and you can receive\nsignificant partial credit for milestones submitted by the end of the quarter. I am here to assist you; just ask for\nhelp.\n\nCourse Objectives\n\ne Explain the design and implementation of a compiler.\n\ne Implement features related to the “back-end” of a compiler.\n\ne Explain and implement code transformations.\n\ne Articulate what an optimizing compiler can do and the implications for how you write code.\nPrerequisites: CSC 430\nTexts\n\nThe recommended course textbook is Engineering a Compiler by Cooper and Torczon or Compilers: Prin-\nciples, Techniques, and Tools by Aho, Lam, Sethi, and Ullman. Supplemental materials will be linked from the\ncourse webpage.\nMay 26, 2020 CSC 431 2\n\nWebpage\n\nClarifications, changes, etc. regarding the class and assignments will be posted to the course webpage\n(http://www.csc.calpoly.edu/~akeen/courses/csc431). Read it regularly, especially near when assignments are\ndue. You are responsible for any announcements posted on the course website.\n\n \n\nActivities\nClass Participation\n\nThe lectures are for your benefit. You should ask questions when you have them. Use lecture time to discuss\ngeneral approaches to the project.\nLecture Comprehension Quizzes\n\nThere will be multiple low-risk quizzes to assess comprehension of lecture material. These will generally be\nposted on the day of each lecture with an extended period of time to complete them.\n\nProject\n\nThere is one large project with multiple milestones. The due dates for the milestones are listed on the\nschedule. You are allowed, but not required, to work with a single partner on the project.\n\nEach milestone must be demonstrated in lecture or lab on the day that it is due to earn full credit. Milestones\nare graded based on a somewhat subjective measure of how “complete” the required functionality is. Milestone\ncompletion may be demonstrated by the “final demonstration” date for significant partial credit.\n\nYou must submit your final project by the date specified on the schedule. This submission must include all\nof your source code, instructions on how to build your project, and instructions on using your compiler.\nChoose Your Own Adventure — Project Paths\n\nEach final project submission will be evaluated based on the ability to generate valid code for the provided\nacceptance tests. There are multiple legitimate paths to completing the project, with varying learning outcomes\nand, as such, varying potential final course grades. These are summarized as follows.\n\n \n\n| Name Description Maximum Grade\n| LLVM-only | Register-based LLVM - without optimizations (1-3)\n\n| LLVM-opt Register-based LLVM - with optimizations (1-3, 6)\n\n| Unoptimized | Assembly from register-based LLVM - without optimizations (1-5)\n| Optimized Assembly from register-based LLVM - with optimizations (1-6)\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n|W) WO\n\n \n\nPaper\n\nEach group will submit a paper detailing the design and implementation of their compiler project. At least\nhalf of the grade for the paper will depend on the presentation of some performance analysis of the code generated\nby the group’s compiler. Further details are provided on the course website.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nGrading\nThe percentage breakdown for the course grade is as follows.\nActivity % per | % total\nQuizzes 5\nMilestones 5 30 |\nFinal Submission 50 50\nPaper 15 15\nTotal 100\n\n \n\nCollaboration and Cheating\nStudents may work in pairs on the project. Each student/pair is expected to complete their own project\nwithout collaboration with others.\nMay 26, 2020 CSC 431 3\n\nIt is fine to talk with others about general approaches to the project, but each student/pair is to develop their\nown solution; collaborative efforts beyond a recognized pair are not allowed. Students/pairs are not to view any\nother student’s code or exchange code in any form (hardcopy or electronically).\r'),

The course reviews theoretical and practical contributions to the field of fixed\nincome securities in the following areas: debt instruments, fixed income securities markets, techniques\nto value default-free and defaultable debt securities with or without embedded options, measuring and\nmanaging risks associated with investing in fixed income securities, with emphasis on the analysis of\ninterest rate and credit risks. This is a required course for finance concentration and provides the\nfoundation for higher-level required and elective finance courses.\nCOURSE METHODS\n\nThe course involves a combination of teaching and learning methods:\n\n1. Readings of textbook to preview concepts and establish advanced terminology (mandatory)\n2. Pre-class online quizzes covering the reading assignments and other materials\n3. Short lectures to review specific concepts and the toolbox of fixed income securities\n4. Inclass problems (labs) to be solved in groups\n5. Mini-presentations on current financial and economic issues\n6. Excel workshops as an application of the skills learned in the course toward real world\nproblems using spreadsheet environment\n7.

Other good examples are Business and Deal Book\nsections of NY Times, Economist, and APM Marketplace podcast.\n\nMini-presentations\nEach student is required to form a group of 3 to 4 to make a brief presentation. The presentation is\n\nlimited to no more than 10 minutes per team. The topic must be a current event relating to the subject\nmatter of the course. Typically your presentation will be based on an analytical article from a current\nbusiness publication. Please verify with me if your proposed topic meets the above criterion. You are\nrequired to provide a hard copy of the reference you are using for presentation to me on the day of\n\npresentation.\nIMPORTANT DATES\nSeptember 29 Deadline to Schedule Your Presentation\nOctober 17 First Midterm\nNovember 14 Second Midterm\nDecember 10 Final Exam\nGRADING POLICY\n\nAssignments 20%  Pre-class quizzes and post-class homework\nMini-presentations 10% Group presentation on a related current topic\nFirst Midterm Exam 20% Covers topics 0, 1 and 2\n\nSecond Midterm Exam 20% — Covers topics 3, 4 and 5 (non-cumulative)\nFinal Exam 30% — Covers everything (cumulative)\n\nAll submissions for the assignments must be done online thorough the PolyLearn.\n\nGrading and Regrading\nI follow Finance area guidelines for grading (see below). There will be no makeup exam and no\n\npartial grading for this course, i.e., only final answer matters. Please note that to get a full credit for\nquantitative multiple choice questions you need to show your work; guessing does not help. If you\nthink there has been an error regarding your grade, you may submit a written grade appeal within a\nweek after the grades are posted. An appeal will involve regarding the whole exam, and may lead to\nboth a lower or higher grade.\n\nArea Grading Policy\nThe finance area currently uses a standardized grading policy for all finance classes. That is, the\n\nproportion of A’s, B’s, C’s, etc. must adhere to general guidelines. Specifically, the policy is:\n¢  A’s Maximum of 25%\n¢ C’s Range of 20% to 40%\n\n¢  D’sand F’s combined: Expected minimum of 10%, but could be 0%.\n\nThe policy is employed to insure that (i) the grade of A is reserved for outstanding performance, and (ii)\nany student who performs poorly will receive a D or F. If all students perform well, no D’s or F’s will be\ngiven.\n\nThe phrase “Expected minimum of 10%” is used in the “D’s and F’s” category because history has shown\nthat approximately 10% to 20% of the class typically underperforms. However, the 10% minimum is a\n“soft” target. That is, if the entire class performs well, then the number of D’s and F’s will be 0%. Of\ncourse, if there are a large number of poor performing students, then the combined number of D’s and F’s\ncan exceed 10%.\n\nExam Session Policy\n\nExams are closed-book and closed-notes. You are only allowed to bring a one page handwritten cheat\nsheet to each exam (one-sided for midterm and two-sided for the final). The cheat sheet will be graded\nwith the exam. You may bring a basic business calculator to the exam (neither a cell phone nor a\nprogrammable calculator) but should also be prepared to use the formulas instead of the financial\nfunctions of your calculator. All other electronic devices including cell phones must be tuned off and\nput away during the exam.\nCLASS ATTENDANCE\n\nI strongly encourage you to attend all classes and actively participate in class discussions. You should\nbring a name card to class. I may not formally take attendance every session but tend to remember\nfaces and names. If you are repeatedly absent from classes it will materially affect your grade. If you\nmiss a class, it is your responsibility to check with a classmate on what took place during that class.\nUse of computers, laptops, tablets, and smart phones is not generally allowed in this class unless it is\nauthorized by the instructor.\n\nCOMMUNICATION PROTOCOL\n\nAll online communications should be done thorough PolyLearn (not e-mail). If a question is potentially of\ninterest of the other students you are encouraged to post it on the forum under the related topic.\nImportant/urgent announcement are sent to you via e-mail. Please make sure that you are on my mailing\nlist. If not, please let me know.\n\nACADEMIC INTEGRITY POLICY\n\nStrict adherence to the highest standards of academic honesty is essential for a trusting and productive\nlearning environment. I expect that you will explicitly make it clear whenever you want to use someone\nelse’s ideas in your work. This includes your work on both final project and the class assignments such as\nhomework and labs. The vast majority of students at Cal Poly does their work honestly, and expects that all\nwill be graded on merit. In order to ensure fair grades, cheating and plagiarism will not be tolerated. We\nwill abide by Cal Poly’s Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities (OSRR). You are responsible for\nknowing what plagiarism is. If you have questions, please see the OSRR website at\nhttp://www.osrr.calpoly.edu/plagiarism/ The sanctions for cheating and plagiarism will be an “F” for the\ncourse and the misconduct will be reported to the OSRR.\n\nSTATEMENT OF DISABILITY\nIf you require using Disability Resource Center (DRC) please let me know during the first week of the\nclass.\n\nCOURSE SCHEDULE\n\nThis is a tentative outline for the course. Changes may be made as the course progresses. Please make\nsure you check the course website on PolyLearn regularly for any updates. Throughout the course, I may\ncover materials that are not from the textbook, including articles and video clips on current events, and\nExcel modeling. It is ultimately students’ responsibility to track ALL the material covered in class AND\nthe textbook.\nCourse Topics\n\nTopic 0: Preview of the Course\nOverview of the Syllabus and Course Website\n\nOverview of Fixed-Income Security Markets\nReview of Bond Pricing\n\nTopic 1: Overview of Debt Instruments, Sectors and Risks\nFeatures of Debt Securities\n\nRisks Associated with Investing in Bonds\n\nOverview of Bond Sectors and Instruments\n\nChapters 1, 2 and 3\n\n \n\nTopic 2: Introduction to Bond Pricing, Yields and Spreads\nUnderstanding Yield Spreads: U.S. Treasuries, STRIPS\nIntroduction to the Valuation of Debt Securities\n\nYield Measures, Spot Rates, and Forward Rates\n\nChapters 4, 5 and 6\n\nTopic 3: Interest Rate Risk, Volatility and Term Structure\nIntroduction to the Measurement of Interest Rate Risk\nDuration and Convexity Measures\n\nTerm Structure and Volatility of Interest Rates\n\nSwap Curves\n\nChapter 7 and 8\n\n \n\nTopic 4: Valuing Bonds with Embedded Options\nValuation Using Binomial Models\n\nCallable and Putable Bonds\n\nConvertible Bonds\n\nChapter 9\n\n \n\nTopic 5: Credit and Interest Rate Risks and Derivatives\nGeneral Principles of Credit Analysis\n\nCredit Risk Models\n\nCredit Derivatives\n\nInterest Rate Derivative Instruments\n\nChapter 13 and 15\n\n \n\nTopic 6: Bond Portfolio Management and Immunization Strategies\nIntroduction to Bond Portfolio Management\n\nMeasuring a Portfolio’s Risk Profile\n\nManaging Funds against a Bond Market Index\n\nPortfolio Immunization and Cash Flow Matching\n\nChapters 16, 17, 18 and 19\r'),

Topics include: study of human characteristics affected by interface design, effective requirements data collection and\nanalysis, user-centered approaches to software engineering, and evaluation of interface and interaction quality. 3 lectures, 1\nlaboratory.\n\nPrerequisites: Junior standing and CSC/CPE 307 or CSC/CPE 308. Students should be familiar with basic Web design and\nprogramming. Experience in the usage of the following Web design tools and technologies is advantageous:\n\ne Design tools such as Frontpage, Dreamweaver.\ne Advanced markup languages based on XML.\ne@ Web scripting and programming methods such as Javascript, CGI, PHP, ASP, JSP.\n\nGoals and Objectives\n\nThe goal of this introductory course in user interface design and development is to raise awareness for the importance of user-\ncentered principles to the design of good interfaces and effective human-computer interaction. In order to achieve this, human\ncharacteristics that are affected by interface design will be identified and discussed. The collection and analysis of effective\nhuman-centered data for interface and interaction requirements provides a firm foundation for the actual user-centered interface\ndesign and implementation, and the evaluation of an interface and its interaction quality.\n\nClass Theme\n\nOverview of Topics\n\nI am planning to cover the topics below. Some adjustments in the sequence and coverage may be made as the quarter progresses.\n\ne Introduction: What are User-Centered Design (UCD) and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)? What are important\ncomponents of UCD and HCI:\n\ne Human Aspects of UCD and HCI: Cognitive Frameworks for HCI; Perception and Representation; Attention and\nMemory Constraints\n\ne Interaction/Interface Design: Principles of User-Centered Design; Methods for User-Centered Design (User Analysis,\nTask Analysis, Environment Analysis); Guidelines: Principles and Rules\n\ne Interaction/Interface Evaluation: The Role of Evaluation; Collection of Usage Data; Methods for Conducting Usability\nStudies\n\ne Technology Aspects of UCD and HCI: Input and Output Devices and Methodologies; Interaction Styles\nTextbooks\n\nThe following textbook will be used in this course. The course schedule identifies the chapters in the book that correspond to a\ntopic discussed in class. Students are expected to read the respective chapters before the topic is covered in class.\n\ne Interaction Design by Jenny Preece, Yvonne Rogers, and Helen Sharp. 2nd edition, John Wiley & Sons: New York,\n2007.

The assignments are intended to provide an introduction to skills needed to\ndesign and evaluate good interfaces, which will lead to effective human-computer interaction. The requirements may include\nwritten reports and/or summaries to be posted on the class web site as well as oral presentation of results and relevant discussion\nin class. There will be some freedom in the choice of tools, methods, or topics, and you are encouraged to coordinate the work\non the assignments with the work on the project.\n\nDesign Project\n\nThe project this quarter will be done in collaboration with Lauren Tsung, a Cal Poly alumna now working at Yahoo. She will\nvisit the class on Thu, Jan 7, to discuss the project in more detail. In contrast to similar projects involving industry collaboration\nin the SE capstone courses where multiple teams work on the same topic, there will be different topics available.\n\nClass Presentations and Participation\n\nThis class will rely on interactive classroom activities, such as participation in group discussions, presentation of ideas and results\n(from textbook, class or assignments), leading discussions on selected readings, providing written summary materials (as web\nfiles via Blackboard), etc. Success in this class depends on regular attendance, preparation of assigned readings and homework\nexercises, as well as a level of professionalism in the class presentations. Peer evaluations may be included as part of the grade.\nPolicy on Late Work and Extensions\n\nMuch of the graded work in this class depends strongly on presentations and documentation material. Once a team or individual\nhas committed to a date for the presentation, extensions or changes in the dates will only be permitted for documented medical or\ndocumented emergency reasons.\n\nGrading Policy\n\nI will use the following allocation of scores for the calculation of the grades.\n\ne Assignments: 50%\n@ Project: 40%\ne Class Participation: 10%\n\nI reserve the right, however, to change the formula used. The project and most of the assignments will be done in teams. My\nevaluation will consider the performance of the team as a whole unless there is a clear disparity in the contribution of the\nindividual team members. Should this be the case, I may ask for additional documentation like work sheets, email messages, or\ndraft copies of documentation to evaluate individual contributions.\n\nFor the team grades, feedback through peer evaluations will also be considered (although I will not use it directly in the\ncalculation of the score).\n\n© 2011 Franz Kurfess Contact\r'),

From humble\ngrade school word problems to the secret search algorithms of Google to the\nesoteric and vaunted invariant subspace problem, linear algebra is a pillar of the\ncomplete mathematical education. One could (and people do) spend a lifetime\nstudying our subject; we have ten weeks. Thus, our aim in this first course is\nto understand the basic principles underlying the greater field. Along the way\nwe\'ll do a few computations, see the solutions of linear systems of equations in\ntheir natural abstract algebraic light, and look eagerly ahead toward the bigger\nquestions and their often powerful answers. It’s a beautiful story, read on.\n\nMethodology\nOur high ambitions will necessitate various vehicles for progress.\n\n1. Discussion. Class time will be spent discussing and working on math-\nematics. Your engagement in the discourse is vital. You may be called\nupon to offer your thoughts or work a problem at your desk. You will get\nout of class only what you put in.\n\n2. Homework. Homework is suggested nightly out of the book. Each Fri-\nday, a custom made assignment will come out to be done over the weekend\nand turned in on Tuesday in class. These weekly homework sets will re-\nflect what you have been working on out of the book leading up to that\nFriday, so it is important to give each suggested book problem due atten-\ntion in order to prepare for your weekend assignment. “Feast or famine”\nis not the proper course here. Consistent and careful consideration of the\nhomework is the surest path to success.\n\n3. Examination. There will be two midterms and a final exam at the end\nof the quarter.\n\n4. Query. Two students will be drawn randomly for a daily query at the\nbeginning of each class.\nMath 206 Linear Algebra Fall 2016\n\n \n\nOffice Hours\n\nOur in-class discussions will likely be the proverbial “tip of the iceberg.” To\nfacilitate sustained mathematical discussion, there will be additional times to\ninteract throughout the week.\n\ne M 2:10-3:00 (library fishbowls).\ne T 10:10-11:00.\ne R 2:10-3:00 (library fishbowls).\ne F 10:10-11:00.\n\ne By email and by appointment.\n\nExam Dates\n\n1.

Final Exam:\ne 206-01: Friday, December 16th, 10:10am-1:00pm\ne 206-02: Monday, December 12th, 1:10pm-4:00pm\ne 206-03: Friday, December 16th, 1:10pm-4:00pm\n\nGrading\n\nCourse grades will be calculated as follows:\n@ Query (5%)\n\ne Homework (20%)\n\ne Midterm Exam (2 x 20%)\n\ne Final Exam (35%)\n\nAcademic Integrity\n\nIt is my opinion that there is hardly any human act more satisfying or\nimportant than the sharing of knowledge. I therefore consider the classroom\nand the university at large to be hallowed ground, well deserving of all the\nhumility and respect that we would afford our other most sacred places.\n\nPlease refer to the University’s policy on cheating and plagiarism found in\nthe Campus Administration Manual, Section 684.\n\nIn short: be sensible, respectful and mindful of the integrity of the system\nwe are all so lucky to share.\r'),

Two midterms and a final exam\n\nDAMAPYNS\nTEXT and MATERIALS\n\nRequired Textbook\ne Fundamentals of Corporate Finance by Jonathan Berk, Peter DeMarzo, and Jarrad Harford\n(BDH), 3\" (or 2\") edition, Prentice Hall, 2015\no Note that there is a custom edition available at the bookstore that contains the chapters we cover.\no You may choose to use the advanced version of the book (listed below). There is almost enough\noverlap of the material, but the order of chapters and problems are different.\n\nYou might want to visit: http://www.myfinancelab.com . The website is an optional supplement for the\ntextbook. It is not required for you to purchase access to the website; however it can be a useful learning\ntool that gives you more practice to deepen your understanding of what we cover in class. If you would\nlike to buy access, you can use the course ID: rastad57163.\n\nRecommended Textbooks\n\ne Valuation: Measuring and Managing the Value of Companies, 5th Edition By McKinsey &\nCompany Inc., Tim Koller, Marc Goedhart, David Wessels (KGW).\nThe book is written from the practitioners’ point of view with references to leading academic\npapers. I highly recommend this book especially if you are interested in a career in Corporate\nFinance.\n\ne Financial Modeling using Excel and VB, Chandan Sengupta, Wiley Finance, 2009\n\ne Financial Modeling, Simon Benninga, MIT Press, 2008\n\ne Corporate Finance (BD) by Jonathan Berk, and Peter DeMarzo, 3 edition, Prentice Hall, 2013\n(the advanced version of the class textbook, BDH)\n\nOther Readings\nI also strongly recommend that you subscribe to a financial newspaper such as the Wall Street Journal.\n\nOther good examples are the Business and Deal Book sections of The NY Times, The Economist, and the\nAPM Marketplace podcast.\n\nIMPORTANT DATES\nFebruary | First Midterm\nFebruary 10 First Project Report (Workshops | to 4) Due at 11:30 PM\nMarch 8 Second Midterm\nMar 17 Final Project Report (Workshops | to 8) Due at 11:30 PM\nMar 22 Final Exam\n\nCLASS ATTENDANCE\n\nI strongly encourage you to attend all classes and actively participate in class discussions. You should\nbring a name card to class. I may not formally take attendance every session but I tend to remember\nfaces and names. If you are repeatedly absent from class it will materially affect your grade. If you miss\na class, it is your responsibility to check with a classmate to learn what took place during the class. Use\nof computers, laptops, tablets, and smart phones is not generally allowed in this class unless authorized\nby the instructor.\nGRADING POLICY\n\nAssignments 15% Pre-class and post-class quizzes, homework, mini-cases, etc.\nFinal Project 20% Project proposal, two reports: summary and spreadsheet.\nFirst Midterm Exam 20% Covers topics 0,1,2, 3, and 4\n\nSecond Midterm Exam 20% Noncumulative; covers topics 5, 6, and 7\nFinal Exam 25% Cumulative; covers topics 0 to 8\n\nAll submissions for the assignments and the project must be done online thorough the Poly Learn.\n\nGrading and Regrading: I follow Finance area guidelines for grading (see below). There will be no\nmakeup exam and no partial grading for this course, i.e., only final answers matter. Please note that to\nget full credit for quantitative multiple-choice questions you need to show your work; guessing does not\nhelp. If you think there has been an error regarding your grade, you may submit a written grade appeal\nwithin a week after the grades are posted. An appeal will involve re-grading the entire exam and may\nlead to either a lower or higher grade.\n\nArea Grading Policy: The finance area currently uses a standardized grading policy for all finance classes.\nThat is, the proportion of A’s, B’s, C’s, etc. must adhere to general guidelines. Specifically, the policy is:\ne A’s Maximum of 25%\n\ne C’s Range of 20% to 40%\ne D’sand F’s combined: Expected minimum of 10%, but could be 0%.\n\nThe policy is employed to ensure that (i) the grade of A is reserved for outstanding performance, and (ii) any\nstudent who performs poorly will receive a D or F. If all students perform well, no D’s or F’s will be given.\nThe phrase “Expected minimum of 10%” is used in the “D’s and F’s” category because history has shown\nthat approximately 10% to 20% of the class typically underperforms. However, the 10% minimum is a “soft”\ntarget. That is, if the entire class performs well, then the number of D’s and F’s will be 0%. Of course, if\nthere are a large number of poorly performing students, then the combined number of D’s and F’s can exceed\n10%.\n\nExam Session Policy: Exams are closed-book and closed-notes. You are only allowed to bring a one-\npage handwritten cheat sheet to each exam (one-sided for midterm and two-sided for the final). The\ncheat sheet is collected with the exam and will be graded. You may bring a basic business calculator to\nthe exam (neither a cell phone nor a programmable calculator) but should also be prepared to use the\nformulas instead of the financial functions of your calculator. All other electronic devices including cell\nphones must be tuned off and put away during the exam.\n\nFINAL PROJECT\n\nAs an application of the skills learned in the course you will build a detailed valuation report step by step as\nthe course progresses. For this project, you choose a publicly traded firm (so that there will be no data\navailability concern). You will perform a thorough valuation analysis, forecast the firm’s earnings, and\nfinally make investment recommendations. Please refer to Final Project handout for more details and\nguidelines.\nCOMMUNICATION PROTOCOL\n\nAll online communications should be done through PolyLearn (not e-mail). If a question is potentially of\ninterest of the other students you are encouraged to post it on the forum under the related topic.\nImportant/urgent announcements are sent to you via e-mail. Please make sure that you are on my mailing\nlist. If not, please let me know.\n\nACADEMIC INTEGRITY POLICY\n\nStrict adherence to the highest standards of academic honesty is essential for a trusting and productive\nlearning environment. I expect you to make it explicitly clear whenever you use someone else’s ideas in your\nwork. This includes your work on both final project and class assignments such as homework and labs. The\nvast majority of students at Cal Poly do their work honestly and expect that all will be graded on merit. In\norder to ensure fair grades, cheating and plagiarism will not be tolerated. We will abide by Cal Poly’s Office\nof Student Rights and Responsibilities (OSRR). You are responsible for knowing what plagiarism is. If you\nhave questions, please see the OSRR website at http://www.osrr.calpoly.edu/plagiarism/ Sanctions for\ncheating and plagiarism will be an “F” for the course, and the misconduct will be reported to the OSRR.\n\n \n\nSTATEMENT OF DISABILITY\nIf you require use of the Disability Resource Center (DRC) please let me know during the first week of the\nclass.\n\nCOURSE SCHEDULE\n\nThis is a tentative outline for the course. Changes may be made as the course progresses. Please make sure\nto check the course website on PolyLearn regularly for any updates. Throughout the course, I may cover\nmaterials that are not from the textbook, including current events, Excel modeling, articles and papers. It is\nultimately the students’ responsibility to track the textbook and ALL other material covered in class. In\nwhat follows, the book chapters (in /talic) are from BDH unless otherwise stated.\n\nTopic 0: Preview of the Course\nOverview of the Syllabus and Final Project\n\nIntroduction to Corporate Finance\nChapter I [Corporate Finance and the Financial Manager] (1.1, 1.3, 1.4, 1.6)\n\nTopic 1: Valuing Cash Flow\nReview of the Time Value of Money and Interest Rates\n\nChapter 4 [Time Value of Money: Valuing Cash Flow Streams] (all sections including the appendix) and\nChapter 5[Interest Rates] (5.1, 5.3)\n\nTopic 2: Capital Budgeting\n\nEstimating Free Cash Flow\n\nOptions in Corporate Finance\n\nReal Options (Rule of Thumb)\n\nChapter 9 [Fundamentals of Capital Budgeting] (all sections)\n\nTopic 3: The Cost of Capital and Valuation\nWeighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC)\n\nValuation: Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Method\n\nComparables and Multiples\n\nChapter 13 [The Cost of Capital] (all sections) and Chapter 10 [Stock Valuation: A Second Look] (10.1,\n10.2)\n\nTopic 4: Long-Term Financing\n\nRaising Equity Capital\n\nDebt Financing\n\nChapter 14 [Raising Equity Capital] (all sections) and Chapter 15 [Debt Financing] (all sections)\n\nTopic 5: Capital Structure\n\nMM Theorem: Capital Structure Irrelevance\nDebt and Taxes\n\nCost of Financial Distress\n\nOptimal Capital Structure\n\nChapter 16 [Capital Structure] (all sections)\n\nTopic 6: Valuation with Leverage\nWACC Method Revisited\n\nAdjusted Present Value (APV) Method\nFlow-to-Equity Method\nChapter 18 of BD [Capital Budgeting and Valuation with Leverage] (18.2, 18.3, 18.4)\n\nTopic 7: Payout Policy\nDividend vs. Repurchase\n\nMM Theorem: Payout Policy Irrelevance\nTax Considerations\n\nPayout vs. Cash Retention\n\nChapter 17[Payout Policy] (all sections)\n\nTopic 8: Mergers and Acquisitions\n\nSynergies\n\nTakeover Process and Defense\n\nLeverage Buyouts and Spin offs\n\nChapter 22 [Mergers and Acquisitions] (all sections)\n\nTopic 9: Corporate Governance\nAgency Conflict and Monitoring\n\nCompensation Policies\nChapter 29 of BD[Corporate Governance] of BD (all sections)\nFinal Project\n\nObjective\n\nAfter joining an investment bank you are approached by a client who is interested in acquiring/merging\nwith a target company. Your role is to prepare a professional report on the target company valuation.\nYou will perform a thorough valuation analysis of the target, forecast its cash flows, and make\ninvestment recommendations to the board of the client company. Your final report includes a two-page\nexecutive summary of your findings, and an appendix containing all your spreadsheets.\n\nChoosing a Firm\nThe first step for this project is to pick a proper target company based on the following criteria:\n\nThe target must be a publicly traded non-financial US company\n\nIt must NOT be on the “List of Companies Chosen by Former Students” on PolyLearn\n\nThe target must be a parent company and not a subsidiary\n\nIt is much easier to work with focused companies than with conglomerates\n\nIt must have at least 10 years of financial statements and stock price data\n\nTo make it more realistic it would be interesting (but not required) if you can find a potential\nM&A target.\n\nRecommended Resources\n1. Part 1 and Part 2 of the recommended book on Valuation (KGW)\n2. Chapters 2 and 18 of the course textbook, (BDH).\n3. Chapters 2 and 19 of the more advanced version of the textbook, (BD).\n4. SEC filings of the target company such as 10-K (annual report), 8-Q, etc.\n5. Other resources posted on PolyLearn: Mergent, Morningstar, Yahoo Finance, etc.\n\nProject Format\nYou must submit two documents electronically (via PolyLearn) as your final project:\n\ne A two-page executive summary\no It includes a total of 10 paragraphs.\no. The first and the last paragraph are introduction and conclusion.\no Each of the other 8 paragraphs summarizes the main findings of each workshop.\no Use plain non-technical language that requires no technical background to understand.\ne A spreadsheet\no It consists of 8 separate sheets; one for each of the workshops listed in the outline section.\no Your spreadsheet must show the steps you followed in each workshop (e.g., show formulas).\no Do not include raw data in the main body of the spreadsheet (e.g. time-series of stock price).\no Tables and graphs should be clearly labeled, and sources should be properly cited.\n\nPlease note: You will lose a significant portion of your grade if you miss a deadline.\nREPORT OUTLINE\nThis is a tentative outline for the project.

Because of this,\nthe traditional 90-A, 80-B, 70-C grading schema does not work in my classes.\nHistorically, the A/B cutoff has been around 80-85%, while the B/C cutoff has\nbeen around 67-70%.\n\nCourse Policies\n\nExams\n\nThere will be a midterm exam and a final exam in the course.\n\nThe midterm will probably take place on one of the following days: February\n10 (Friday), February 13 (Monday), or February 15 (Wednesday).\n\nOur final exam is scheduled for Wednesday, March 22, 10:10 - 1:00pm.\n\nMake-up exams will not be given, unless there are extraordinary circum-\nstances present and I am notified in advance. The policy regarding the use of\ntextbooks and notes will be announced at least one week prior to each exam.\nHomeworks, Labs\n\nThe course will have 6-8 lab assignments, designed to let you test in practice\nwhat we have learned in class. Each lab assignment will span multiple lab\nssions (typically 2 or 3). Due dates/times will be explicitly provided for each\nsignment. Typically, the assignments are due midnight of the day of the last\nlab period. Often a new lab assignment will already have been specified by\nthen. You are welcome to work on the lab assignments outside the lab hours,\nhowever, lab period attendance is highly encouraged.\n\nGroups/pairings are to be formed by you - I will only intervene if someone\ncannot find a group/pair, or if there is a hard-to-resolve issue that requires my\nattention. You are welcome to stay in the same group/pair for multiple lab\nassignments, or form a new group/pair for each non-individual assignment. All\nmembers of a group will recieve the same grade for the assignment.\n\nIn addition to labs, a number of paper-and-pencil homeworks will be as-\nsigned. Homeworks are my way of providing you with some exam study guides.\nHomeworks will be collected, but will not, as a rule, be graded.\n\n  \n\nLate Submissions\n\nAll assignments are due at classtime on the due date: homeworks - at the\nbeginning of the class (with grace period extending to the beginning of the lab\nperiod); lab assignments - at the end of the lab period. Any deviations from\nthese rules will be spelled out explicitly in the assignments.\n\nHomework/lab assignments submitted later than indicated above will be\nconsidered late submissions.\n\nIf paper-and-pencil homework solutions are distributed on the due date of\nthe homework, late homework submissions will not be accepted. Oth-\nerwise, late homeworks can be submitted during next 24 hours for a 10-30%\npenalty (the exact amount will depend on the submission time and the specific\ncircumstances). No homework submissions will be accepted afterwards.\n\nLate lab assignment submissions can be turned in before or at the beginning\nof the next lab period for a 10-30% penalty (the exact amount will depend\non the submission time and the specific cireumstances\'). No lab assignment\nsubmissions will be accepted after that.\n\nCommunication\nThe class has an official mailing list:\ncpe-369-01-2172@calpoly.edu\n\nAll students enrolled in the class are automatically subscribed to the mailing\nlist.\n\n1The penalty will be larger if the gap between the two lab periods includes a weekend and\nsmaller otherwise\nI encourage questions during classtime and questions via email. My answers\nto email questions may be broadcast to the entire class via the mailing list, if the\nanswer may be relevant to everyone (e.g. a correction in a text of a handout,\nor a clarification of a homework problem), and may also appear on the web\npage. The questions can also be posted to the mailing list directly. The mailing\nlist will also be used for all annoucements related to the course. It is your\nresponsibility to read your class-related email. Failure to read email posted to\ncs405001 mailing list cannot be used as an excuse in the class.\n\nWeb Page\nClass web page can be found at\nhttp: //www.csc.calpoly.edu/~dekhtyar/369-Winter2017\n\nThrough this page you will be able to access all class handouts including\nhomeworks, project information and lecture notes (should the latter be written).\n\nAcademic Integrity\n\nUniversity Policies\n\nCal Poly’s Academic Integrity policies are found at\nhttp: //www.academicprograms.calpoly.edu/academicpolicies/Cheating.htm\nIn particular, these policies define cheating as (684.1)\n\n“... obtaining or attempting to obtain, or aiding another to obtain\ncredit for work, or any improvement in evaluation of performance, by\nany dishonest or deceptive means. Cheating includes, but is not lim-\nited to: lying; copying from another’s test or examination; discussion\nof answers or questions on an examination or test, unless such discus-\nsion is specifically authorized by the instructor; taking or receiving\ncopies of an exam without the permission of the instructor; using or\ndisplaying notes, ”cheat sheets,” or other information devices inap-\npropriate to the prescribed test conditions; allowing someone other\nthan the officially enrolled student to represent same.”\n\nPlagiarism, per University policies is defined as (684.3)\n\n“... the act of using the ideas or work of another person or persons\nas if they were one’s own without giving proper credit to the source.\nSuch an act is not plagiarism if it is ascertained that the ideas were\narrived through independent reasoning or logic or where the thought\nor idea is common knowledge. Acknowledgement of an original au-\nthor or source must be made through appropriate references; i.e.,\nquotation marks, footnotes, or commentary.”\nUniversity policies state (684.2): “Cheating requires an “F” course grade and\nfurther attendance in the course is prohibited.” (appeal process is also outlined,\nsee the web site above for details.). Plagiarism, per university policies (684.4)\ncan be treated as a form of cheating, although a level of discretion is given to\nthe instructor, allowing the instuctor to determine the causes of plagiarism and\neffect other means of remedy. It is the obligation of the instructor to inform the\nstudent that a penalty is being assessed in such cases.\n\n \n\nCourse Policies\n\nAll homeworks are to be completed by each student individually. Lab assign-\nments are to be completed by the appropriate units (individual, pair, group),\nand no code/solution-sharing between units is permitted. Students are encour-\naged to discuss class content among themselves but NOT in a manner that con-\nstitutes plagiarism and cheating as defined above (e.g., you can solve together\na problem from the textbook that had not been assigned in the homework, but\nyou should solve assigned problems individually).\n\non\r'),

I will not be in\nclass for October 30 and, possibly November 1 or October 27 classes. We will\nfigure out what exactly happens to these classes some time in October.\n\nCSC 349 in Fall 2017 There are four sections of CSC 349 taught in Fall\n2017. The other three sections are taught by Dr. Theresa Migler-VonDollen.\nThis section will follow roughly the same schedule and order of topics as Dr.\nMigler-VonDollen’s sections, and will have similar deliverables, although specific\nassignments, handouts, quiz and exam questions (except for the common final)\nwill be unique to our section.\n\nGrading\n\nHomeworks and Labs 25%\nQuizzes 45%\nFinal Exam 30%\n\nI give relatively hard problems and take points off on exams.

The quizzes will take the entire\nlab period. There will be no makeup quizzes. The lowest quiz score will\nbe dropped.\n\n \n\nHomeworks, Labs\n\nThere will be 6-8 lab assignments and, possibly, a number of homework assign-\nments.\n\nLab assignments are intended to give you hands-on experience with design-\ning and implementing well-known algortihms and applying classical problem-\nsolving techniques. Most of the lab assignments will be done in pairs or small\ngroups, although individual assignments are possible as well.\n\nPaper-and-pencil homework assignments will test your problem-solving\nskills related to algorithm design and analysis. They will also prepare you for\nthe quizzws and the final exam. These assignments will typically not be graded,\nbut they may be collected for ”show your work” credit.\n\nProgramming Languages\n\nWe will use Python and Java as our programming languages for lab assignments.\nMost of my examples in class will be in Python (beacuse they are easier to\ndemo). I reserve the right to make certain labs language-specific.\n\nLate Submissions\n\nAll assignments are due at classtime on the due date: homeworks - at the\nbeginning of the class (with grace period extending to the beginning of the lab\nperiod); lab assignments - as directed in each assignment.\nHomework/lab assignments submitted later than indicated above will be\nconsidered late submissions.\n\nIf paper-and-pencil homework solutions are distributed on the due date of\nthe homework, late homework submissions will not be accepted. Oth-\nerwise, late homeworks can be submitted during next 24 hours for a 10-30%\npenalty (the exact amount will depend on the submission time and the specific\ncircumstances). No homework submissions will be accepted afterwards.\n\nLate lab assignment submissions can be turned in before or at the beginning\nof the next lab period for a 10-30% penalty (the exact amount will depend\non the submission time and the specific cireumstances\'). No lab assignment\nsubmissions will be accepted after that.\n\nCommunication\n\nThe class will have an official mailing list. The email address for the mail-\ning list is csc-349-06-2178@calpoly.edu. All students enrolled in the class are\nautomatically subscribed to the mailing list.\n\nI encourage questions during classtime and questions via email. My answers\nto email questions may be broadcast to the entire class via the mailing list, if the\n\n \n\nanswer may be relevant to everyone (e.g. a correction in a text of a handout,\nor a clarification of a homework problem), and may also appear on the web\npage. The questions can also be posted to the mailing list directly. The mailing\nlist will also be used for all annoucements related to the course. It is your\nresponsibility to read your class-related email. Failure to read email posted to\ncs405001 mailing list cannot be used as an excuse in the class.\n\nWeb Page\nClass web page can be found at\nhttp: //www.csc.calpoly.edu/~dekhtyar/349-Fall2017\n\nThrough this page you will be able to access all class handouts including\nhomeworks, project information and lecture notes (should the latter be written).\n\nLinks to web pages with additional information (such as CSLAB database\nsupport page) and important notes and announcements will also be posted.\n\n0.1 Students with Disabilities\n\nIf you have a disability for which you are or may be requesting an accommo-\ndation, you are encouraged to contact both your instructor and the Disability\nResource Center, Building 124, Room 119, at (805) 756-1395, as early as possible\nin the term.\n\n1The penalty will be larger if the gap between the two lab periods includes a weekend and\nsmaller otherwise\nAcademic Integrity\n\nUniversity Policies\n\nCal Poly’s Academic Integrity policies are found at\nhttp: //www.academicprograms.calpoly.edu/academicpolicies/Cheating.htm\nIn particular, these policies define cheating as (684.1)\n\n“... obtaining or attempting to obtain, or aiding another to obtain\ncredit for work, or any improvement in evaluation of performance, by\nany dishonest or deceptive means. Cheating includes, but is not lim-\nited to: lying; copying from another’s test or examination; discussion\nof answers or questions on an examination or test, unless such discus-\nsion is specifically authorized by the instructor; taking or receiving\ncopies of an exam without the permission of the instructor; using or\ndisplaying notes, ”cheat sheets,” or other information devices inap-\npropriate to the prescribed test conditions; allowing someone other\nthan the officially enrolled student to represent same.”\n\nPlagiarism, per University policies is defined as (684.3)\n\n“... the act of using the ideas or work of another person or persons\nas if they were one’s own without giving proper credit to the source.\nSuch an act is not plagiarism if it is ascertained that the ideas were\narrived through independent reasoning or logic or where the thought\nor idea is common knowledge. Acknowledgement of an original au-\nthor or source must be made through appropriate references; i.e.,\nquotation marks, footnotes, or commentary.”\n\nUniversity policies state (684.2): “Cheating requires an “F” course grade and\nfurther attendance in the course is prohibited.” (appeal process is also outlined,\nsee the web site above for details.). Plagiarism, per university policies (684.4)\ncan be treated as a form of cheating, although a level of discretion is given to\nthe instructor, allowing the instuctor to determine the causes of plagiarism and\neffect other means of remedy. It is the obligation of the instructor to inform the\nstudent that a penalty is being assessed in such cases.\n\nCourse Policies\n\nAll homeworks are to be completed by each student individually. Lab assign-\nments are to be completed by the appropriate units (individual, pair, group),\nand no code/solution-sharing between units is permitted. Students are encour-\naged to discuss class content among themselves but NOT in a manner that con-\nstitutes plagiarism and cheating as defined above (e.g., you can solve together\na problem from the textbook that had not been assigned in the homework, but\nyou should solve assigned problems individually).\n\n \n\non\r'),

Many scholarly papers will be assigned for reading\nand discussion. Most papers will be available through the internet and digital libraries.\n\nSchedule\nThis course will meet Monday and Wednesday from 2:10 to 4pm in 14-232B.\n\nCourse Requirements\n\n1. Attendance and Participation\n\nStudents are expected to attend and actively participate in all course meetings and discussions, as\nwell as the course project. Readings will be assigned and must be completed prior to the class in\nwhich they are discussed. Readings will be posted on the course website schedule. Occasional\nquizzes may be given which will count towards the attendance/participation grade. More than\nthree absences for any reason will result in a zero for the attendance/participation grade.\n\n2. Technical Paper Presentations\n\nEach week we will select papers to be discussed in class from software engineering conferences\nand publications such as IEEE Software, IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, the\nInternational Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE), the IEEE Conference on\nRequirements Engineering, and the conference on Object Oriented Programming, Systems,\nLanguages, and Applications (OOPSLA). Although some papers will be selected by the\ninstructor, each student will also select a paper from an assigned issue/conference. These\nselections must be announced to the class one week prior to the date that the paper is to be\ndiscussed. All students are to read the selected papers, and the student who selected each one\nwill lead a discussion on the paper. Students will be graded on their summary of the salient\npoints of the paper, and effectiveness leading the class in a meaningful discussion of the paper.\n3. Research Paper\n\nStudents will write a high-quality, publishable research paper. The topic should be consistent\nwith the topics of this course, but may incorporate the student’s other interests or research. The\npaper should target a particular software engineering conference, journal, or scholarly magazine,\nand should match the respective formatting guidelines. Failure to identify the target venue and\nmatch the formatting guidelines will result in a 15% grade reduction on the paper. You are not\nrequired to submit the paper for publication, but you are encouraged to do so. The goal is that\nyour paper is of publishable quality. Keep track of all contributors so you can properly\nacknowledge them if you do submit for publication. At a minimum, relatively short papers\n(around 5,000 words) could target high-quality magazines such as IEEE Software, IEEE\nComputer, or Communications of the ACM (around 2,500 words). Medium-length papers could\ntarget high-quality conferences such as OOPSLA (max 10,000 words), ICSE (10 pages in ICSE\nformat), IEEE International Requirements Engineering Conference (10 pages IEEE CS format).\nLonger papers could target high-quality journals such as “Transactions on Software\nEngineering” or “Empirical Software Engineering, An International Journal.” Such papers may\nbe spread over the 508 and 509 courses, but a distinct deliverable must be provided in this\ncourse.\n\nThe following deadlines pertain to the research paper:\n1/26/09: Initial Paper Proposal and Presentation\n2/9/09: Structured Abstract & Bibliography\n\n2/25/09: Complete First Draft\n\n3/9/09: Final Paper\n\nFailure to meet an intermediate deadline will result in a 10% reduction in the final paper grade.\n\n4. Software Project\n\nStudents will participate in a group of one to three students to develop, document, and present\nthe requirements, architecture, and prototypes for a software system. The goal of the project is to\napply proven or experimental software practices that are unfamiliar to the student. For example,\na team might apply a product line architecture, develop animated requirements storyboards, or\napply acceptance and unit test driven development. As such, the team will select a particular\nsoftware process and set of practices, and must demonstrate how the process/practices were\nfollowed throughout the project.\n\nProject scope should be commensurate with the team size. The projects need not be particularly\nlarge, but must be significant enough to gain value from applying the process/practices. As a\nguideline, students should expect to spend about 30 hours outside of class on the course project.\n\nThe project grade is assigned subjectively based on the following deliverables (percentages\nindicate portion of the project grade for each deliverable):\n\n1/21/09: Vision and Scope, Process/Practice Proposal (10%)\n\n2/4/09: Requirements Artifacts (25%)\n\n2/18/09: Design Artifacts (25%)\n\n3/20/09: Presentation/Prototype (25%), Process/Practice Report (10%), Self/Peer Evaluation(5%)\nGenerally all team members will receive the same grade, although adjustments may be made if it\nis apparent that a team member failed to fully participate in the project.\n\nThe following are acceptable types of projects:\n\na. Develop a system for an external user,\n\nb. Develop a system in support of software engineering research in conjunction with your\nresearch paper,\n\nc. Develop a replacement for www.evidencebasedse.com,\n\nd. Develop an entrepreneurial application and demonstrate how it can be monetized.\n\n5. Survey of Empirical Studies\nStudents will survey empirical studies on a particular topic. The surveys will be contributed to\nwww.evidencebasedse.com. Students may suggest a new topic, or may select an existing topic\nand add surveys of studies not currently in the database. The topic may relate to the student’s\nresearch paper. Students are expected to contribute a minimum of fifteen study reviews per\nperson (1% of the grade for each one). As a guideline, the topic should come from the following\nSWEBOK Knowledge Areas:\n\ne¢ Software Requirements\nSoftware Design\nSoftware Engineering Management\nSoftware Engineering Process\nSoftware Engineering Tools and Methods\nSoftware Quality\n\nThe following deadlines pertain to the empirical studies:\n1/14/09: Topic Selection with Five Publications\n2/23/09: All publication summaries in DB\n\n6. Review Peer Work\n\nStudents will review each others’ papers at three points: verbal feedback will be given\ncollectively at the initial paper proposal presentations, written feedback of the first complete\ndraft will be given for two peers, and written feedback of the final draft will be given for two\npeers. The last stage of this process is meant to imitate a scholarly peer-review process.\n\nCommunication\n\nThe best place to discuss the course is during class meetings and office hours. All assignments\nand due dates will be announced in lecture and most, if not all, will be placed on the course web\nsite. Most class materials are available on the course web site; be sure to check regularly.\nEmail will only be used for special circumstances, such as communicating time sensitive\ninformation. You may email the instructor regarding personal issues only. If you use email, put\nCSC 508 on the subject line to get the best response time. All students are expected to have their\ncalpoly.edu and csc.calpoly.edu email accounts forward to wherever they will read email at least\ndaily. Leaving phone voicemails should be a last resort.\n\nClassroom Etiquette\n\nTo ensure a professional learning environment, the following rules will be enforced in the\n\nclassroom:\n\n¢ Do not eat except when food is provided for the entire class\n\n¢ Do not use electronic devices that make sounds (e.g. cell phones, ipods)\n\n¢ Do not use computers for anything besides presenting or taking notes when anyone is\npresenting (exceptions will be clearly announced, e.g. during project meeting times)\n\nGrading\n\nThe course grade will be determined on the following factors:\nClass Attendance and Participation (15%)\n\nResearch Paper and Presentations (35%)\n\nPeer Paper Reviews (Draft, Final) (2.5% each)\n\nProject Activities, Artifacts, and Presentations (30%)\nEmpirical Study Surveys (15%)\n\nVR YeENP\n\nLetter grades will be assigned based on the expectation that an ‘A’ is earned with excellent work\non all aspects of the course, sustained throughout the course. A ‘B’ is earned with very good\nwork, perhaps excellent at times. A ‘C’ is earned with average work, perhaps very good at times\nbut poor at other times. A ‘D’ is earned with consistently poor work.\n\nLate Work Policies\n\nA software engineer has a responsibility to manage time effectively and turn in work on time.\nMost deadlines are rarely absolute; if you are having a problem, discuss it as far in advance as\npossible. Failure to do so will result in a grade reduction.\n\nIntegrity\n\nAll work submitted is to be your own. Cooperative study and mutual aid are healthy learning\nmethods and are strongly encouraged. You are especially encouraged to build on the work of\nothers. Just cite sources of anything you have copied, summarized or discussed directly with\nanother. It is cheating to copy someone\'s work or allow someone to copy your work. It is\ncheating to copy material from a publication without giving credit. Plagiarism will result in a\ncourse grade of F. When you find good ideas by other people, the best policy is to summarize\nother work in your own words and cite their work as the source for the principle you state.\nCiting resources is not a sign of weakness of your own ideas, it is a sign that you can do research\nand build on others\' work.\r'),

Alternatively, students may pursue independent research project of\ntheir own if they have a viable research plan. The professor will oversee these projects and guide\nstudents in this effort.\n\nCOURSE METHODS\n\nStudents may choose one from the following three alternatives as their research question:\n1.Analysis of a merger and acquisition deal, 2.Analysis of a real estate investment project, and\n3.The traditional research project. Please consult the handouts for more description for each of\nthe three choices. Students are encouraged to work in teams. The maximum size for a team is\ntwo. Students choose their desired option in the first session and turn in a short proposal, which\ndocuments their research plans in a ten-weeks window.

For \"Superior\" grade I look for creative and clever\nextensions in the study beyond the scope of definitions in the proposal.\n\nFINAL REPORT FORMAT\n\nA key part of the credibility of a research project is the quality of the written report. It should be well\norganized, and divided into logical subsections and paragraphs. The main body of the report must be\nunderstandable to a client with no technical background. Technical terms and acronyms, if used, should be\ndefined when first used, and/or in an appendix. Also technical material such as regression diagnostics tests,\nexcel spreadsheets, etc. should be moved to the appendix. Tables and graphs should be clearly labeled, with\nfootnotes or captions to explain them. They should be referred to in the body of the report. Sources should\nbe properly cited in the footnote. Please consult a technical writing manual of style. If you are uncertain as\nto the acceptability of a given format, please check with me.\nCOMMUNICATION PROTOCOL\n\nAll online communications should be done thorough PolyLearn (not e-mail).

Carlton and Jay L. Devore (available from SpringerLink on library site)\n\nCourse Webpage: http://statweb.calpoly.edu/arossman/stat305/\nThis webpage contains much information, including the course syllabus, handouts,\nassignments, solutions, and announcements. You can find a link to it from PolyLearn.\n\nOverview:\n\n“We see that the theory of probability is at bottom only common sense reduced to\ncalculation; it makes us appreciate with exactitude what reasonable minds feel by a sort\nof instinct, often without being able to account for it....It is remarkable that this science,\nwhich originated in the consideration of games of chance, should have become the most\nimportant object of human knowledge....The most important questions of life are, for the\nmost part, really only problems of probability.” — Pierre Simon, Marquis de Laplace\n\n“The greatest challenge in understanding the role of randomness in life is that although\nthe basic principles of randomness arise from everyday logic, many of the consequences\nthat follow from those principles prove counterintuitive.” — Leonard Mlodinow, The\nDrunkard’s Walk: How Randomness Rules Our Lives\n\nProbability is the mathematical study of uncertainty or randomness. Although the famous\nmathematician Laplace no doubt overstated the point in the passage above, there is no denying\nthat the concept of uncertainty pervades our everyday lives and that the mathematics of\nprobability has become a very useful tool in a wide variety of fields. But as Dr. Mlodinow’s\nremarks indicate, many studies have shown that human intuition does not generally deal well\nwith issues of uncertainty. This speaks to why it’s important to undertake a careful and\nsystematic study of randomness. This course provides an introduction to the fundamental\nconcepts and methods of probability with an emphasis on their applications to many disciplines\nas well as everyday life.\n\nPreview: To whet your appetite for the types of questions that we will investigate, I present this\nsampling:\n1. Ifa hospital were to distribute a group of newborn babies to their mothers at random,\nhow many mothers would we expect to get paired with the correct baby?\n2. Based on forensic evidence obtained at the scenes of the crimes, how did probability\narguments help a jury to reach a verdict in the celebrated case of “Sneaky,” the man\naccused of raping several women in the Shadyside district of Pittsburgh in 1985-86?\n3. How likely is it that you and a friend will meet for lunch, if your arrival times are random\nand you agree to wait only for a certain length of time?\n\n4. Ifa person tests positive for the AIDS virus, what is the probability that you have actually\nbeen infected?\n\n5. Why cana fickle contestant double his/her chances of winning the jackpot on a game\nshow?\n\n6. Can the rules for a series of sports games be modified in order to identify the better team\nwith fewer games played?\n\n7. How many people must be in a room in order to have a 70% chance that at least two of\nthem share the same birthday?\n\n8. What is the probability that you would pass a multiple choice exam by sheer guessing?\n\n9. A pregnant woman writes to Dear Abby saying that her military husband is the father of\nher child even though it was 310 days between her husband’s last visit and her child\'s\nbirth! What are the chances of that?\n\n10. How likely is an absent-minded professor to have an umbrella when he needs one?\n\n11. How can the Army determine which soldiers have a certain disease without performing\nthe expensive blood test needed to detect the disease on each and every soldier?\n\n12. A much higher percentage of men than of women was admitted to the graduate school of\nthe University of California at Berkeley in the fall quarter of 1973. Can we attribute the\ndifference to sex discrimination?\n\nPrerequisites: The prerequisites for this course are knowledge of differential and integral\ncalculus for one variable, covered by MATH 141, 142, 143, and fundamentals of computer\nprogramming, covered by CPE 101. We will also make occasional use of set-theoretic properties\nand operations, which we will review briefly at the appropriate time. No prior knowledge of, or\nfamiliarity with, probability or statistics is assumed or expected.\n\nGoals: By the conclusion of the course, I hope that you have acquired the ability to:\n\ne understand fundamental concepts of the mathematical theory of probability, including\nconditional probability, independence, random variables, probability distributions, and\nexpectations;\nperform a wide variety of probability calculations and derivations;\nuse probability ideas to examine properties of statistical estimators;\nwrite computer programs to simulate and analyze random processes;\napproach and solve practical problems through probabilistic reasoning;\ncommunicate your knowledge of probability effectively.\n\nCourse materials: I will post handouts for every class session by the previous evening. I think\nyou’ll find it very helpful to print these in advance and bring them to class, so you can take notes\ndirectly on the handouts. The handouts will consist of questions that we answer during class and\nalso some exposition that summarizes key concepts and results.\n\nThe textbook is recommended and not required, but it contains clear exposition and many\nexercises with which to develop and assess your understanding.\nYou will find much helpful information posted at the course website, so please check there often.\nYou must also have a calculator and access to the R statistical software package.\n\nClassroom culture: Please come to class prepared and willing (preferably eager!) to engage in\nclass and answer my questions and collaborate with your peers and ask questions of me. This\nwill not only help you to learn the material and perform well in the course, but it will also\nproduce a much more enjoyable learning environment for all of us. Class attendance is very\nstrongly encouraged, because I hope that our class sessions will prove to be valuable learning\nexperiences. Missing class would be especially problematic because we only have two class\nmeetings per week. Needless to say, you are responsible for everything presented in class.\n\nI also expect you to devote substantial outside-of-class time to your work for this course,\ntypically involving 8-12 hours per week. I anticipate that this work will be divided among:\ne reviewing your class notes\ne reading the textbook\ne solving homework problems\ne working on investigation assignments\ne preparing for exams\n\nComputer use: We will make extensive use of computers in this course. They will prove useful\nin at least three ways:\n1. for facilitating probability calculations;\no Many of the calculations that we’ll learn are very cumbersome to do by hand.\n2. for addressing “what if” questions that allow you to explore probability concepts;\no Wecan investigate the effects of tweaking various aspects of problems by\nobtaining immediate feedback.\n3. for conducting simulations to investigate long-run behavior of random phenomena;\no Simulation is an extremely powerful tool, not only for exploring probability\nconcepts but also for solving problems that are too complex to be analyzed\nanalytically.\n\nFor these purposes we will make frequent use of both applets and the statistical software package\nR, which includes a powerful programming language. We will use R both for probability\ncalculations and also for conducting more extensive simulation analyses. Instructions for\ndownloading R and also RStudio, a package that provides R with a more user-friendly interface,\nboth of which are freely available, can be found on our course webpage.\n\nGrading policies: Your course grade will be determined by the following components, with\nrelative weights as indicated:\n\n© Quizzes (5%)\n\ne Homework assignments (12.5%)\n\ne Investigation assignments (12.5%)\n\ne Midterm exams (3, 15% each)\n\ne Final exam (25%)\nQuizzes: We will have quizzes during most class meetings, one per handout, and we may also\nhave some take-home quizzes. Some will be individual quizzes, while others will be group\nquizzes. You may drop the lowest two of your quiz scores from the calculation of your overall\naverage.\n\nHomework assignments: Homework assignments will be given regularly, one per handout,\nroughly two per week. These will be due at the beginning of class on the indicated day.\nAssignments and solutions will be posted on the course webpage. These assignments will\ntypically involve several questions, intended to help you learn and apply the concepts and\ntechniques presented in that handout. You may drop the lowest of your homework scores from\nthe calculation of your overall average. You may work with a group of as many as three students\non these assignments, submitting one assignment with all names, provided that you all contribute\nsubstantially to the work.\n\nInvestigation assignments: Investigation assignments typically ask you to analyze a more\ncomplex problem, often addressing multiple aspects of the problem an. These investigations\ntypically require use of software and often require writing computer code. These will be\nassigned occasionally, and you will have several days to complete these investigations. You may\nwork with a group of as many as three students on these investigations, submitting one report\nwith all names, provided that you all contribute substantially to the work. You may also discuss\nthese problems with others, but you may not share computer code.\n\nYour solutions to investigation assignments must be word-processed, with computer output\nintegrated into the report. These investigation assignments will be posted on the course website.\nThey are due when indicated on the assignment, which may not be during class time. You may\nnot drop any of your investigation scores from the calculation of your overall average, but you\nmay have a 48-hour extension on the due date for one of the investigation assignments.\n\nExams: We will have three midterm exams and a final exam. The final exam will include a\ncumulative component but will focus on more recent material. You may take an exam late only\nwith if you have a written medical excuse. These exams will be open-book and open-notes. You\nwill have 50 minutes to work on each midterm exam and 170 minutes for the final exam. You\nwill be provided with preparation advice before each exam. The exam dates will be announced\nat least one week in advance.\n\nAcademic Honesty: Please conduct yourself with honesty and integrity. Do not submit others’\nwork as your own. For assignments and quizzes that allow you to work with a group, only put\nyour name on what the group submits if you genuinely contributed to the work. Work\ncompletely independently on exams, using only the materials that are indicated as allowed.\nFailure to observe academic honesty results in substantial penalties that can include failing the\ncourse.\n\nDisabilities: If you have a disability and would like to request accommodation, please contact\nme and the Disability Resource Center (bldg 124, room 119) as soon as possible.\n\nSchedule: The following is a very tentative schedule, always subject to change:\nWeek Dates Topics Sections of Text\n1 Sept 22 — 23 Introduction 1.1\n2 Sept 26 — 30 Basic rules, Counting methods 1.2-1.3\n3 Oct 3-7 Conditional probability, Bayes’ Theorem 1.4\n4 Oct 10-14 Independence, EXAM 1.5\n5 Oct 17-21 Discrete random variables 2.1—2.3\n6 Oct 24 — 28 Binomial and related distributions 2.4-2.6\n7 Oct 31 — Nov 4 EXAM, Continuous random variables 3.1—3.2\n8 Nov 7-10 Normal and exponential distributions 3.3-3.4\n9 Nov 14-18 Joint distributions, EXAM 4.1-4.2\n10 Nov 28 — Dec 2 Sampling distributions, CLT 4.5\n11 Dec 5-9 Statistical estimators, “Choosing the Best’’ 5.1\nFINAL EXAM\n\n \n\n \n\nAdvice: I offer the following Top Ten (plus one) list of very simple but often ignored pieces of\nstudy hints for your consideration:\n\n1.\n\n2.\n\n3.\n\n8.\n\n9.\n\n10.\n\n11.\n\nCome to class.\n\no Il do my best to make class time valuable for learning and also enjoyable.\nParticipate in class.\n\no Participation is what makes class worthwhile.\nPrint handouts in advance, take good notes.\n\no These should be very valuable to study from.\nAsk questions.\n\no Inclass, and in office hours, and by email\nHelp each other.\n\no Youcan learn a lot by working together.\nStart assignments early.\n\no Especially with investigation assignments that can be fairly extensive.\nDon’t get behind.\n\no The material will build on itself and go by fairly quickly.\nExpress yourself clearly.\n\no Toavoid miscommunications about a sometimes tricky topic.\nHave fun with the material.\n\no We’ll be studying lots of interesting and fun problems!\nTake pride in your work.\n\no Do the best you can with everything that you do in the course.\nThink!\n\no That’s what pursuing a Cal Poly education is all about!\n\nA common theme emerges from this list: You are responsible for your own learning.

In particular, I will assume fa-\nmiliarity with Relational Database model and SQL.\n\nThe first lab of the course is used to test your knowledge of SQL, and your\nability to work with Oracle DBMS using sqI*plus environment.\n\nLabs, Project, Homeworks\n\nProject. The course will have a quarter-long group project devoted to an\nimplementation of a simple (but real) DBMS. The project will be organized\nin a number of stages, each stage will be graded and will receive a score that\ncounts towards the total project score, although opportunities to fix problems\nwith earlier deliverables will be given.\n\nLabs. Labs will be used to facilitate the course project and to test some of\nthe knowledge obtained in lectures. In the first half of the course labs will\nbe devoted to project setup and preparation issues: study of the packages,\ntechnologies, APIs and query languages needed for the project. Prior to the\ndirect use of this information in the project, a lab will be offered to get you\nfamiliarized with the necessary concepts. In the later parts of the course, labs\nwill target some of the theoretical and practical material learned in the lectures\n(such as query optimization and transaction processing).\n\nMost of the labs will be team-based (to be performed by the project teams).\nOccasional lab periods may be used for project discussions/demos or as a group\nmeeting time for the project.\n\nWe will try to align lab assignments with weeks, but this is not guaranteed.\nEach lab assignment is due by the end of lab period on the due date, unless\nspecified otherwise. You are welcome to work on the lab assignments outside\nthe lab hours, however, lab period attendance is mandatory. You may\nonly leave the lab period (a) with the express permission of the instructor if (b)\nthe current assignment is complete and the next assignment has not been made\navailable yet.\n\nHomeworks. Paper-and-pencil homeworks will be assigned occasionally. The\nmain purpose of the homeworks is preparation for the exams.\nLate Submissions\n\nTypically, paper-and-pencil homeworks are due in class, labs are due at the end\nof the lab period on the due date and project stages are due at midnight of the\ndue date. Exact assignment/project submission instructions will be included\nwith the assignments. Be sure to follow exactly the submission procedures.\nHomework/projects submitted later than indicated will be considered late sub-\nmissions.\n\nLate paper-and-pencil homework submissions will not be accepted.\n\nLate lab and project submissions are strongly discouraged. A penalty of 10\n- 30% will be assessed for any submissions that are late by less than 24 hours.\nNo credit will be given for any later submissions. You are encouraged to submit\nyour code on time even if it is not perfect. You can then debug your code and\nsubmit a fixed version late, subject to the abovementioned rules. When more\nthan one submission is present, we will independently grade two submissions: (i)\nthe latest on-time submission and (ii) the latest late submission for which non-\nzero credit can be assessed. Your grade for the project will be the maximum\nof the two grades.\n\nCommunication\n\nThe class will have an official mailing list. The email address for the mailing\nlist is cpe-468-05-2108@calpoly.edu. All students enrolled in the class are au-\ntomatically subscribed to the mailing list (using the email addresss that the\nCS department has on file). You are allowed to tranfer the subscription to an-\nother account (e.g., CSLAB account). However, you must stay subscribed to\nthe mailing list for the entire duration of the class.\n\n \n\nI encourage questions during classtime and questions via email. My answers\nto email questions may be broadcast to the entire class via the mailing list, if the\nanswer may be relevant to everyone (e.g. a correction in a text of a handout,\nor a clarification of a homework problem), and may also appear on the web\npage. The questions can also be posted to the mailing list directly. The mailing\nlist will also be used for all annoucements related to the course. It is your\nresponsibility to read your class-related email. Failure to read email posted to\nthe mailing list cannot be used as an excuse in the class.\n\nWeb Page\nClass web page can be found at\nhttp: //www.csc.calpoly.edu/~dekhtyar/468-Fall2010\n\nThrough this page you will be able to access all class handouts including\nhomeworks, lab assignments, project information, lab/project data and lecture\nnotes.\n\nLinks to additional information, and notes and announcements will also be\nposted.\nAcademic Integrity\n\nUniversity Policies\n\nCal Poly’s Academic Integrity policies are found at\nhttp: //www.academicprograms.calpoly.edu/academicpolicies/Cheating.htm\nIn particular, these policies define cheating as (684.1)\n\n“... obtaining or attempting to obtain, or aiding another to obtain\ncredit for work, or any improvement in evaluation of performance, by\nany dishonest or deceptive means. Cheating includes, but is not lim-\nited to: lying; copying from another’s test or examination; discussion\nof answers or questions on an examination or test, unless such discus-\nsion is specifically authorized by the instructor; taking or receiving\ncopies of an exam without the permission of the instructor; using or\ndisplaying notes, ”cheat sheets,” or other information devices inap-\npropriate to the prescribed test conditions; allowing someone other\nthan the officially enrolled student to represent same.”\n\nPlagiarism, per University policies is defined as (684.3)\n\n“... the act of using the ideas or work of another person or persons\nas if they were one’s own without giving proper credit to the source.\nSuch an act is not plagiarism if it is ascertained that the ideas were\narrived through independent reasoning or logic or where the thought\nor idea is common knowledge. Acknowledgement of an original au-\nthor or source must be made through appropriate references; i.e.,\nquotation marks, footnotes, or commentary.”\n\nUniversity policies state (684.2): “Cheating requires an “F” course grade and\nfurther attendance in the course is prohibited.” (appeal process is also outlined,\nsee the web site above for details.). Plagiarism, per university policies (684.4)\ncan be treated as a form of cheating, although a level of discretion is given to\nthe instructor, allowing the instuctor to determine the causes of plagiarism and\neffect other means of remedy. It is the obligation of the instructor to inform the\nstudent that a penalty is being assessed in such cases.\n\nCourse Policies\n\nAll homeworks are to be completed by each student individually. Lab assign-\nments are to be completed by the appropriate units (individual, pair, group),\nand no code/solution-sharing between units is permitted. Students are encour-\naged to discuss class content among themselves but NOT in a manner that con-\nstitutes plagiarism and cheating as defined above (e.g., you can solve together\na problem from the textbook that had not been assigned in the homework, but\nyou should solve assigned problems individually).\n\n \n\non\r'),

This your first Computer Science course. Informally, the\ncourse has two goals: (i) to explain to you what Computer Science is as a\ndiscipline and a profession and (ii) to give you basic knowledge of a modern\nprogramming language (C).\n\nSomewhat more formally, the course objectives are:\n\ne Learn the basic principles of problem solving in Computer Science.\n\ne Learn the basic principles of software development process.\ne Learn one modern procedural programming language (C).\n\ne Prepare for CPE 102.\n\nTextbook\n\nRequired: Problem Solving and Program Design in C, Hanly and Koffman,\nAddison Wesley, 4th Edition (ISBN: 0-321-19803-4) or 5th Edition (ISBN: 0-\n321-40991-4), Addison Wesley.\n\nNote: This book is required. In addition to reading, homework assignments\nwill be given out of the book.\n\nRecommended:\ne The C Programming Language, Kernigan, Ritchie, 2nd Ed, Prentice Hall.\n\nNote: There are many different books on C, and you may already have some.\nPlease consult me, if you want to you such a book throughout the course.\n\nTopics\n\nThe following will be covered in the course.\n\n \n\n2\n°\n\nTopic Duration\n(weeks)\n\n \n\nIntroduction: What is Computer Science\nIntroduction to C/Arithmetics\nInput/Output (I/O)\n\nConditional Statements\n\nLoops\n\nFunctions\n\nArrays\n\nStrings\n\nStructs\n\nPointers\n\nSNOT RN\n\no\n\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n\nb\n2°\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe topics may be covered in a different order.\n\nGrading\n\nHomeworks 5%\nLabs 10-15%\nAutomated Lab Tests #eK\nProgramming Assignments 20-25%\nMidterm Quizzes 30%\nFinal Exam 30-35%\n\nScore Guaranteed Grade\n\n90 — 100 A\n\n80— 89 B\n\n67 — 79 C-\n\n57 — 67 D-\n\nbelow 67% F\nNote: These are guaranteed grades. The final letter grade may be higher\ndepending on the overall performance of everyone in the course and on the\ndifficulty of exams and assignments.\n\nNote: In order to be allowed to register for CPE 102 you must pass CPE\n101 with a grade of C- or higher! A grade of D+, D or D- means that\nyou have to retake CPE 101 before proceeding with the program.\n\nNote: Please note that College of Engineering has instituted strict require-\nments concerning course repetitions and being in good standing, starting this\nacademic year. Please see a separate handout for the outline of these policies.\n\nNote***: A non-failing grade in the course will be assigned to a student\nONLY if the student passed at the lab quizzes. See below for the exact policies.\n\nFurloughs\n\nDuring this academic year all Cal Poly faculty is observing a furlough.\n\nEach full-time faculty member is required to observe six days of furlough\nduring the Fall quarter.\n\nI will be observing the following days:\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nNo. Date Day of Week Effect\n\n1. September 29 Tuesday no effect\n\n2. October 14 Wednsday no class, no office hours\n\n3. October 23 Friday no class\n\n4. November 16 Monday no class, no office hours\n\n5. November 27 Friday no effect (Friday after Thanksgiving)\n6. December 3 Thursday no office hours\n\n \n\nI will be off-campus and unavailable for emails on furlough days.\n\nNote. Please be aware that while the faculty are furloughed, the students\nare not. Unless otherwise announced in advance, the lectures are cancelled on\nfurlough days, however, we keep the lab available to you for the lab session. You\nare expected to attend the lab session and use it to work on you pending lab\nassignment. Assignments may be due for submission on faculty furlough days.\n\nCourse Policies\n\nOverall\n\nWelcome to the Computer Science (Computer Engineering, Software Engineer-\ning) program! Some of the policies in this section may seem intuitive, but since\nthis may be your first college course in your desired major, we outline and stress\nthem here.\n\nWithdrawal. You are free to drop this course during the first eight days of\nthe quarter. Beyond day 8, proof of unusual circumstances is required if you\nwant to withdraw. The instructor has no influence on the withdrawal process.\n\nLine Dropping. You should be aware that the instructor is given the power\nto drop from the course roster any student who is deemed either (a) a no-show\nor (b) to not satisfy course prerequisites. While prerequisite satisfaction will\nbecome more important in later classes, please note, that lack of attendance\nin the fist two weeks of classes may lead to you being dropped from the roster\nas a no-show. If you anticipate not being able to make one or more\nclasses at the beginning of the quarter, please notify the instructor\nin advance!\n\nWaiting Lists. The department tries to accommodate every incoming fresh-\nman and make sure that there are enough sections for everyone to enroll. Occa-\nsionally, this does not work out and students wind up on waiting lists. In CPE\n101 the size of each section is limited by the number of workstations in the lab.\nThis is a hard bound. I will allow students from the wait list (if such exist)\nregister for the course until we reach that limit. (I believe, last quarter it was\n35 or 36, we will make that determination during the first lab). Students will\nbe moved off of waiting list and into the class roster strictly in the order in\nwhich they appear on the waiting list.\n\nIncompletes. A grade of I (Incomplete) will be given strictly in the cases\nstipulated by the university policies. Documentary evidence of the unusual\ncircumstances leading to the assignment of this grade will be required in all\ncases without exception.\n\nCollaboration. Both University and course policies regarding academic in-\ntegrity are outlined at the end of the syllabus. These policies will be strictly en-\nforced throughout the course. All students are required to sign a non-collaboration\nagreement.\n\nProgramming Style. When you submit programs for grading, they will be\nrequired to comply with a programming style sheet, which specifies layout of\nthe code, use of indentation, variable naming, etc. Your instructor will go over\nthis style sheet with you in class. See\n\nhttp: //users.csc.calpoly.edu/~cstaley /General/CStyle.htm\n\nA uniform programming style makes it easier for programmers to work together\non projects, and we will require the same style for all 101 students this fall\nin order to promote uniform style within the major. Any code that varies\nsignificantly from the required style will be handed back to you to redo, possibly\nwith penalties, until it complies with the style sheet.\n\nExams\n\nYou will have three midterm quizzes and one final exam.\n\nThe midterm quizzes will last for 20-30 mins, and will be offered on Mondays\nof Weeks 3, 5 and 7:\nMidterm quiz 1 October 5 Basics of C\nMidterm quiz 2. October 19 Conditions, Loops\nMidterm quiz 3. November 2 Functions\nTo pass an individual quiz you must score 70% or better on it.\n\nWe will have a common final exam for all students in all sections of CPE\n101. The exact day and time of the exam will be announced in advance. Some\nstudents may have conflicts with other common finals (e.g., Calc I). We need to\nbe notified of these conflicts as soon as possible.\n\nMake-up exams for missing quizes will not be given, unless there are ez-\ntraordinary circumstances present and I am notified in advance. By default, the\nexams will be closed book, closed notes. Any exceptions from this rule will\nbe conveyed to you ahead of the exam.\n\nHomeworks\n\nEach new topic in the course comes with assigned reading. The reading\nschedule is posted on the course web page. You are responsible for having\nread the textbook material assigned, even if portions of it are not covered in\nclass, or are not covered in enough detail. Exams may have questions, and lab\nassignments may rely on knowledge contained in the books, but not discussed\nin class (on occasion, this may be done on purpose!).\n\nAdditionally, paper-and-pencil homework will be assigned on occasion. This\nwill mostly involve problem analysis and problem-solving, preparation for in-\nclass lab assignments, and solving problems from the textbook.\n\nLabs, Automated Lab Tests\n\nLab sessions start 10 minutes after the lecture period ends. Except for the first\nweek, I expect everyone to be logged on and ready to work on the assignments\nat the beginning of each lab period.\n\nEach week you will be given a lab assignment, which will advance your practi-\ncal skills with C programming and (hopefully) — with problem solving. The lab\nassignment will typically be given out on a Monday of the week, and will be due\nthe end of the lab period on Friday. On weeks with furlough days, automated\nlab tests and holidays, lab schedule can be altered, and some labs may become\nlonger than 1 week in duration.\n\nYou are welcome to work on the lab assignments outside the lab hours, how-\never, lab period attendance is mandatory. You may only leave the lab period\n(a) with the express permission of the instructor if (b) the current assignment\nis complete and the next assignment has not been made available yet. Some lab\nassignments can be done in pairs or small groups, while others will be individual.\nEach lab assignment will state it explicitly. All members of the group receive\nthe same grade for all group/pair assignments.\n\nAutomated Lab Tests. This is IMPORTANT! Three times during the\nquarter you will have a automated lab test. The automated lab tests will be\nadministered in Weeks 4, 6 and 8 or 9. Tentatively, the days are:\n\nAutomated Test 1 October 12 Conditions\nAutomated Test 2. October 26 Loops\nAutomated Test 3. November 13 Functions\n\nAn automated lab test is a short programming assignment which you must\ncomplete within the allotted time. The allotted time is typically 50 minutes.\nThe assignment must be completed by each student individually and any col-\nlaborative attempts will be immediately regarded as academic cheating and\ndealt with according to the university policies (see below). We expect that all\nor most lab tests will be conducted using a special on-line software system. You\nwill receive some basic training with the tool prior to the first automated test.\n\nLab tests have two key properties: (a) they are graded as pass/fail and do not\ndirectly contribute towards your final grade, and (b) without passing all three\nof them, you will not receive a passing grade in the course. More specifically:\n\ne Grading. The programs assigned to you will contain very specific instruc-\ntions/requirements. As such your program will be expected to pass 100%\nof the instructor’s tests. Failure to produce correct/defined behavior in\nany of the tests will result in you failing the lab test.\n\ne Passing Course. You will receive a passing grade in the course ONLY\nif you successfully pass all three lab tests. Failure to do so will result\nin an automatic assignment of the grade of D or F (as the rest of your\nperformance warrants) to you in this course.\n\ne Retaking Lab tests. Lab tests are to be done in a special environment\nand grading them is automated. Each student will receive a personal\nassignment during the lab test. If the assignment is not completed, you\ncan attempt multiple (until you succeed) retakes of the test. The retakes\nwill be administered by the tutoring center at the CS department (see\nbelow). Each retake must be timed and proctored. Tutoring center staff\nwill provide further retake instructions for you as needed.\n\nPrograms\n\nIn addition to lab assignments, you will also be given three programming assign-\nments during the quarter. In each assignment, I will provide program require-\nments. You will need to do problem analysis, design, implementation, testing\nand documentation. Each assignment will be two-to-three weeks long. These\nassignments are supposed to be completed by you individually (unless stated\notherwise in the specific assignment) outside of the lab sessions.\n\nAssignment Due Times and Late Submissions\n\nEach assignment (homework, lab, program) will be distributed to you in hard-\ncopy as well as made available electronically through the course web page (see\nbelow). Each assignment will specify due date and time as well as give submis-\nsion instructions.\n\nPaper-and-pencil homework assignments are due at the beginning of the\nclass on the due date. Submit them as you walk into the classroom.\n\nLab assignments are due at the end of the lab period, typically, on Friday\nof each week. On occasion, the due time may be extended to midnight. Each\nassignment will specify the due date/time.\n\nPrograms are due at the date and time specified in the assignment. The\ndue time will typically be midnight of the due date.\n\nLate submissions. There is a 24-hour late submission window for program-\nming assignments. This includes programs and most of the lab assignments. A\n10-30% (depending on the time of submission and the type of the assignment)\npenalty will be assessed on any late submission. No late submissions will be ac-\ncepted for credit after the 24-hour period. No late submissions will be accepted\nfor credit for paper-and-pencil homeworks.\n\nThe exceptions to late submission policies are documented unusual cir-\ncumstances. If such circumstances are foreseen, I require prior notice of them.\nIn case of unforeseen circumstances, please make every effort to inform me about\nyour situation as soon as you can. Please note, that almost under no circum-\nstances will any dispensations be given postfactum.\n\nCommunication\nThe course has an official mailing list. The email address for the mailing list is\ncpe-101-08-2098@calpoly. edu.\n\nAll students enrolled in the class are automatically subscribed to the mailing\nlist corresponding to their section.\n\nI encourage questions during class time and questions via email. My answers\nto email questions may be broadcast to the entire class via the mailing list, if the\nanswer may be relevant to everyone (e.g. a correction in a text of a handout,\nor a clarification of a homework problem), and may also appear on the web\npage. The questions can also be posted to the mailing list directly. The mailing\nlist will also be used for all announcements related to the course. It is your\nresponsibility to read y our class-related email. Failure to read email posted to\nthe mailing list cannot be used as an excuse in the class.\n\nWeb Page\nClass web page can be found at\n\nhttp: //www.csc.calpoly.edu/~dekhtyar/101-Fall2009\n\nThrough this page you will be able to access all class handouts including\nhomeworks, lab and program assignments, test data, sample programs and lec-\nture notes (should the latter be written).\n\nAcademic Integrity\n\nPlease read these carefully.\n\nUniversity Policies\nCal Poly’s Academic Integrity policies are found at\nhttp: //www.academicprograms.calpoly.edu/academicpolicies/Cheating.htm\nIn particular, these policies define cheating as (684.1)\n\n“... obtaining or attempting to obtain, or aiding another to obtain\ncredit for work, or any improvement in evaluation of performance, by\nany dishonest or deceptive means. Cheating includes, but is not lim-\nited to: lying; copying from another’s test or examination; discussion\nof answers or questions on an examination or test, unless such discus-\nsion is specifically authorized by the instructor; taking or receiving\ncopies of an exam without the permission of the instructor; using or\ndisplaying notes, ”cheat sheets,” or other information devices inap-\npropriate to the prescribed test conditions; allowing someone other\nthan the officially enrolled student to represent same.”\n\n \n\nPlagiarism, per University policies is defined as (684.3)\n\n“... the act of using the ideas or work of another person or persons\nas if they were one’s own without giving proper credit to the source.\nSuch an act is not plagiarism if it is ascertained that the ideas were\narrived through independent reasoning or logic or where the thought\nor idea is common knowledge. Acknowledgment of an original au-\nthor or source must be made through appropriate references; i.e.,\nquotation marks, footnotes, or commentary.”\n\nUniversity policies state (684.2): “Cheating requires an “F” course\ngrade and further attendance in the course is prohibited.” (appeal\nprocess is also outlined, see the web site above for details.). Plagiarism, per\nuniversity policies (684.4) can be treated as a form of cheating, although a level\nof discretion is given to the instructor, allowing the instructor to determine the\ncauses of plagiarism and effect other means of remedy. It is the obligation of the\ninstructor to inform the student that a penalty is being assessed in such cases.\n\nCourse Policies\n\nMany of your lab assignments, and possibly some of the projects, will allow work\nin pairs or teams. Its easier for many people to explore difficult new material\nwith a partner to work with. However, you will be required in your professional\nwork to be able to write programs on your own as well. For this reason several\nof the class programming projects will be designated as individual work only.\nYou are required to do your own work on these assignments.Collaboration on\nsuch projects is strictly forbidden, and you must sign a contract agreeing to this\nstandard .\n\nIf you’re accustomed to a high-school environment where cheating is discour-\naged but not really punished, please become unaccustomed to it immediately.\nWe\'re very serious about this rule, because we know that individual work is\nan essential part of what you need to be successful professionals. Cheating will\nnot only be punished with an F for the course; it will also result in you being\nreported to the University authorities.\n\nIf you feel you cannot complete the work on your own, the right solution is\nto come to your instructor and ask for help or to use the resources described\nbelow. We will give you individual attention, and a student tutor to assist you\nas well, but well make sure you ultimately are able to program on your own.\n\nThe penalties for cheating on individual assignments apply not only to the\nreceiver of help, but also to the giver. Even well-intentioned help can seriously\ndegrade a fellow students education if it is done incorrectly. Do not offer as-\nsistance to fellow students on individual assignments, and keep your own work\nsecure.\nIf you are actively interested in learning how to tutor fellow students, please\nEmail Dr Staley at cstaley@calpoly.edu. He runs our tutoring center, and teaches\na course for students interested in tutoring (CSC 303). Once you learn how to\nhelp fellow students in a way that enhances their education, wed value your\nassistance in the tutoring center. (And well pay you for it, too.) If you have any\nquestion regarding the cheating standards, please feel free to ask us. We don’t\nmind such questions; in fact we appreciate them because they show that you’re\ntaking the standards seriously.\n\nSupport and Advancement\n\nCPE 105 and CSC Tutoring Center\n\nThere are two resources you may find especially helpful if you would like tutorial\nassistance with this course. Both of these are allowed sources of help under the\nnoncollaboration agreement, even for individual projects:\n\nCPE 105X is a support course for 101 students, which meets twice weekly, and\nis conducted by a carefully chosen and trained teaching assistant. Enrollment\nfor this course is available throughout the add period, and we encourage you to\nsign up. In some cases, if we feel it is important to your success (e.g. if you are\nfailing the lab programming tests), we may require you to attend a CPE 105\nsection even if you are not registered for it.\n\nThe CPE 105X web page is\nhttp: //wiki.csc.calpoly.edu/cpe105\n\nThe CSC department also runs a tutoring center. See\nhttp: //www.csc.calpoly.edu/resources/tutoring/.\n\nWe recommend this center if you are having difficulty in the course.\n\nCPE 108\n\nSome of you may already have prior programming experience. If you do, and you\nthink that you will be bored in 101, but can handle a course with a faster pace,\nplease contact the course instructor, Professor Clint Staley at cstaley@calpoly.edu\nwithin the first week of classes to see if you can be placed in CPE 108.\r'),

The course will cover foundational principles of chemistry.\nTopics this quarter will include mathematical methods in chemistry, atomic structure, the periodic table,\nstoichiometry, acid-base chemistry, solubility, thermochemistry, gas laws, quantum mechanics, bonding,\n\nmolecular structure, intermolecular forces, and phase transitions.\n\nCourse Instructor\n\nProf. Seth Bush 127 Faculty Offices East (Bldg. 25) (805) 756-2746\nsbush@calpoly.edu http://chemweb.calpoly .edu/sbush/\n\nOffice Hours\n\nOpen office hours: Wednesday-Friday 12:30-1:30 pm; 25-127\n\nReviews and problem sessions: Tuesday 5-6:30; 38-131\n\nIn general, my door is always open and you are welcome to drop by with questions, problems or concerns.\n\nReading Material\n\nSilberberg, CHEMISTRY; The Molecular Nature of Matter and Change 6\" Edition. Tentative reading\nassignments are posted on the back of this document. Reading is not optional. It is essential! To make the most\nof each class period, reading assignments should be completed before lecture. Be sure to re-read tough sections.\nPlease note: the 5\" edition of Silberberg is an acceptable substitute.\n\n \n\nLecture\nLectures are held Mon & Wed 6:10- 7:30 pm in 33-286. While attendance is not mandatory, material for exams\nwill be drawn directly from lecture. It is difficult to do well in this class if you do not attend lecture regularly.\n\nExams\nThere will be two midterm exams and one cumulative final exam. Exam material will be drawn from\nhomework, lecture, and your text. See back for exam dates.\n\nHomework Quizzes\n\nHomework problems for each chapter are outlined on the back of the syllabus. In addition, I will post “you can\ndo it” questions after each lecture. These are questions you should be able to do based on the day’s lecture.\nWhile written homework assignments will not be turned in, there will be weekly homework quizzes in the first\nten minutes of each Wednesday’s lecture. Quiz material will be drawn from the previous week\'s assignment.\n\nQuick-Writes\n\n \n\nDuring most lecture periods you will be asked to complete a “Quick-| Graded Material Points\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nWrites” assignment. These 1-3 minute assignments are designed to help Homework Quizzes: 100 (20/quiz)\n\n \n\nyou gauge your progress in class and allow you to plan accordingly. Quick Writes: 30 (2/QW)\n\n \n\nLaboratory Midterm Exams: 300 (150/MT)\n\n \n\nYour laboratory performance will constitute 20% of your final grade. See Final Exam: 210\n\n \n\n \n\nlaboratory syllabus for details. Laboratory: 160\n\n \n\n \n\nClass Policies\n¢ There will be no make up exams! If you know you are going to miss an exam or quiz for a legitimate\nreason you must contact me prior to the exam or quiz date.\n¢ You may only use non-programmable calculators in this class. You may not share calculators during exams.\n¢ Cutoffs for grades will be no higher than those listed below, but may be lowered if appropriate.\nA | B | Cc | D | Other\n90 80 70 60\nCourse Management\n\nMaking the transition to college level work can be a daunting task. This class will cover a substantial amount of\nmaterial in a relatively short amount of time. Keeping on top of things is key to your success. Below are a few\ntips that I believe will help you succeed in this class:\n\nBE ACTIVE IN CLASs (Chemistry Class is not a spectator sport):\n\nTake good notes. Your notes from class are essential for working hw problems and preparing for\nexams. Taking notes also helps you keep focused on lecture.\n\nWork problems with the class. These are “good” problems, they will help you with your hw and exams.\nParticipate in class discussions. Don’t be afraid to be wrong or look foolish, everyone is wrong now and\nthen. You will learn from your mistakes. The only bad question is the one you don’t ask.\n\nReally do the quick write assignments. They are designed to help you gauge your progress and keep on\ntrack.\n\nBE ACTIVE OUTSIDE OF CLASS:\n\nStudy a Minimum of 8-10 hours a Week. This should include working lots of problems, actively\nreading your text, and digesting your notes from class. The online homework assignments represent a\nbare minimum of work to do well in this class. Below are additional suggested problems from your text.\nForm a study group to work through problems. You will learn by teaching and you might just make\nfriends. As a note of caution: This should supplement independent work, not take its place.\n\nCome to office hours and reviews with questions and problems you would like to see worked out.\n\nGET OUTSIDE HELP (if you need it):\n\nTake responsibility for your education. If you need more help or feel that you are under-prepared for\nthis course, you should not hesitate to enroll in Supplemental Instruction.\n\nUltimately you are responsible for your education. The more energy and time you put into this class the more\nyou will get out of it. If you feel yourself getting lost and you need some guidance, come see me. Together we\ncan get you back on the right path.\n\nTentative Course Calendar*\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nWeek Reading Notes Week Reading Notes\n1: 9/17-21 Chapter 1,2, 4 | Holiday 9/17 7:10/29-11/2 Chapter 8\n2: 9/24-28 Chapter 4, 3 8: 11/5-9 Chapter 9 | Midterm II: 11/7*\n3: 10/1-5 Chapter 3, 5 9: 11/12-16 Chapter 10 | Veteran’s Day 11/12\n4: 10/8-12 Chapter 5 Midterm I: 10/10* | 10: 11/19-23 Ch 10, 12 Turkey Day 11/21-23\n5: 10/15-19 | Chapter 6 11:11/26-30 Chapter 12\n6: 10/22-26 | Chapter 7 Final Exam: | Friday. 12/7, 4-7pm\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSuggested Book Problems\n\nFrom 6\" or 5\" editions:\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nCh. 1: | 1, 30, 36,39, 41, 42, 44, 48, 52,55, 59, 66, 78 Ch. 7: 5,7, 11, 34, 39, 43, 51,54, 60, 63, 64, 70, 73, 95\nCh. 2: |, 1,21, 41,44, 48, 50, 63, 69, 87,94, 99 Ch. 8: 1,9, 12, 22, 24, 34, 36, 41,54, 55, 74, 80, 86, 89\nCh. 3: || 7,9, 12, 26, 33, 41, 44, 46, 53, 65,73, 84, 96,100 | Ch. 9: 9, 15,26, 31,41. 49,51, 58,61\n\nCh. 4: | 6, 15, 23, 29, 38, 54(52), 55(53), 66(64), 76(74),80 | Ch. 10: | 3,6,7, 12, 14, 22, 36, 37, 48, 62, 73\n\nCh.5: | 7, 19, 21.22, 33, 46,52, 55, 61,71, 72,77, 80,89 | Ch.12: | 3,14, 15, 20,25, 29, 39, 43,50, 121\n\nCh. 6: 1,9, 15, 23, 27, 38, 39, 42, 46, 53,54, 58, 65,71,\n\n \n\n \n\n77, 80,90, 105\n\n \n\n \n\nNote: The 5\" and 6\" editions have mostly the same questions.

During the course the students\nwill learn the basic concepts of data management, the principles of operation of\nrelational DBMS (Database Management Systems) and the principles of build-\ning database applications on top of relational DBMS. The students will study the\nSQL query language for relational data, and will learn how to use it to construct\nsoftware that relies on DBMS to manage its data. In addition, some theoretical\naspects of database management will be covered, as well as an overview of the\ninternal organization of the DBMS. Course labs will use Oracle DBMS.\n\nTexbook\n\nRequired: A First Course in Database Systems, J.D. Ullman, J.

Because of this,\nthe traditional 90-A, 80-B, 70-C grading schema does not work in my classes.\nHistorically, the A/B cutoff has been around 80-85%, while the B/C cutoff has\nbeen around 67-70%.\n\nCourse Policies\n\nExams\n\nThere will be one midterm exam and a comprehensive final exam.\nThe midterm exam date is May 1 (Thursday), May 6 (Tuesday) or May 8\n(Thursday)\n\nOfficial date for the final exam: June 10 (Tuesday), 1:10pm.\n\nMake-up exams will not be given, unless there are extraordinary circum-\nstances present and I am notified in advance. The policy regarding the use of\ntextbooks and notes will be announced at least one week prior to each exam.\n\nHomeworks, Labs\n\nThe course will have 6-8 lab assignments, designed to let you test in practice\nwhat we have learned in class. Each lab assignment will span multiple lab\nsessions (typically 2 or 3). Each lab assignment is due by the end of lab period\non the due date (unless specified otherwise). You are welcome to work on\nthe lab assignments outside the lab hours, however, lab period attendance is\nmandatory. You may only leave the lab period (a) with the express permission of\nthe instructor if (b) the current assignment is complete and the next assignment\nhas not been made available yet. Some lab assignments can be done in pairs or\ngroups of three, while others will be individual. Each lab assignment will state\nit explicitly.\n\nGroups/pairings are to be formed by you - I will only intervene if someone\ncannot find a group/pair, or if there is a hard-to-resolve issue that requires my\nattentions. You are welcome to stay in the same group/pair for multiple lab\nassignments, or form a new group/pair for each non-individual assignment. All\nmembers of a group will recieve the same grade for the assignment.\n\nIn addition to labs, a number of paper-and-pencil homeworks will be as-\nsigned. Homeworks will typically consist of problems taken from database text-\nbooks, or similarly styled problems.\n\nLate Submissions\n\nAll assignments are due at classtime on the due date: homeworks - at the\nbeginning of the class (with grace period extending to the beginning of the lab\nperiod); lab assignments - at the end of the lab period. Any deviations from\nthese rules will be spelled out explicitly in the assignments.\n\nHomework/lab assignments submitted later than indicated above will be\nconsidered late submissions.\n\nIf paper-and-pencil homework solutions are distributed on the due date of\nthe homework, late homework submissions will not be accepted. Oth-\nerwise, late homeworks can be submitted during next 24 hours for a 10-30%\npenalty (the exact amount will depend on the submission time and the specific\ncircumstances). No homework submissions will be accepted afterwards.\n\nLate lab assignment submissions can be turned in before or at the beginning\nof the next lab period for a 10-30% penalty (the exact amount will depend\non the submission time and the specific circumstances!). No lab assignment\n\n1The penalty will be larger if the gap between the two lab periods includes a weekend and\nsmaller otherwise\nsubmissions will be accepted after that.\n\nCommunication\n\ns will have an official mailing list. The email address for the mail-\ns cpe-365-01-2084@calpoly.edu. All students enrolled in the class are\nautomatically subscribed to the mailing list.\n\nT encourage questions during classtime and questions via email. My answers\nto email questions may be broadcast to the entire class via the mailing list, if the\nanswer may be relevant to everyone (e.g. a correction in a text of a handout,\nor a clarification of a homework problem), and may also appear on the web\npage. The questions can also be posted to the mailing list directly. The mailing\nlist will also be used for all annoucements related to the course. It is your\nresponsibility to read your class-related email. Failure to read email posted to\ncs405001 mailing list cannot be used as an excuse in the class.\n\n \n\n \n\nWeb Page\nClass web page can be found at\nhttp: //www.csc.calpoly.edu/~dekhtyar/365-Fall2007\n\nThrough this page you will be able to access all class handouts including\nhomeworks, project information and lecture notes (should the latter be written).\n\nLinks to web pages with additional information (such as CSLAB database\nsupport page) and important notes and announcements will also be posted.\n\nAcademic Integrity\n\nUniversity Policies\n\nCal Poly’s Academic Integrity policies are found at\nhttp: //www.academicprograms.calpoly.edu/academicpolicies/Cheating.htm\nIn particular, these policies define cheating as (684.1)\n\n“... obtaining or attempting to obtain, or aiding another to obtain\ncredit for work, or any improvement in evaluation of performance, by\nany dishonest or deceptive means. Cheating includes, but is not lim-\nited to: lying; copying from another’s test or examination; discussion\nof answers or questions on an examination or test, unless such discus-\nsion is specifically authorized by the instructor; taking or receiving\ncopies of an exam without the permission of the instructor; using or\ndisplaying notes, ”cheat sheets,” or other information devices inap-\npropriate to the prescribed test conditions; allowing someone other\nthan the officially enrolled student to represent same.”\n\nPlagiarism, per University policies is defined as (684.3)\n“... the act of using the ideas or work of another person or persons\nas if they were one’s own without giving proper credit to the source.\nSuch an act is not plagiarism if it is ascertained that the ideas were\narrived through independent reasoning or logic or where the thought\nor idea is common knowledge. Acknowledgement of an original au-\nthor or source must be made through appropriate references; i.e.,\nquotation marks, footnotes, or commentary.”\n\nUniversity policies state (684.2): “Cheating requires an “F” course grade and\nfurther attendance in the course is prohibited.” (appeal process is also outlined,\nsee the web site above for details.). Plagiarism, per university policies (684.4)\ncan be treated as a form of cheating, although a level of discretion is given to\nthe instructor, allowing the instuctor to determine the causes of plagiarism and\neffect other means of remedy. It is the obligation of the instructor to inform the\nstudent that a penalty is being assessed in such cases.\n\nCourse Policies\n\nAll homeworks are to be completed by each student individually. Lab assign-\nments are to be completed by the appropriate units (individual, pair, group),\nand no code/solution-sharing between units is permitted. Students are encour-\naged to discuss class content among themselves but NOT in a manner that con-\nstitutes plagiarism and cheating as defined above (e.g., you can solve together\na problem from the textbook that had not been assigned in the homework, but\nyou should solve assigned problems individually).\n\non\r'),

It is the same quantum mechanically. You can\nprove this if you want! For <p>, you should think how this operator related to the operator for\nthe total energy of this system. They are very similar!!\n\nCompare your overall result for ApAx to that predicted by the uncertainty principle. Does your\nanswer make sense? Are you sure or are you uncertain!

Confusion\nAt times we will use quantities in SI units, at times in atomic units, and maybe\neven cgs units. You should get used to being confused and paying careful\nattention to the unit system used. For example, in SI units we need to include the\npermittivity of free space, 4st¢,, in expressions involving electrostatic interactions,\nbut in the cgs system we do not. Also we use expressions involving i, the square\nroot of —1. Remember, (i)\' = -i. ) (Aye, aye aye!!)\nA Quantum Mechanic’s Vocabulary\n\nHamiltonian — total energy (kinetic - T, plus potential - V) of a system\nH=T+V\n\ne.g. for harmonic oscillator,\n1 1. Pp ;\n==mv +—k? oP\n2 2m 2\n\nFunction — single valued, continuous\n\nOperator — mathematical expression (often given Greek symbol, such as a or £,\nsometimes with a “hat”) which “acts” on a function. Can change the function into a\n“new” function or can result in original function multiplied by a constant\n\nOperator Algebra — when several operators operate on a function, they operate from\n“inside out’, that is, if have two operators a and 6 and a function f, aBf = a(Pf). First\noperate on f with 8, then operate on this resultant function with a\n\nCommuting operators — if have two operators a and £ and a function f, the two operators\nare said to commute if:\napf = paf\n\nEigenvalue equation: if an operator, a, operates on a function, w, and the result is the\nsame function, w, multiplied by a constant, a, then the equation:\n\naw= ay\n\nis called an eigenvalue equation and a is called the eigenvalue and w is an eigenfunction\nof the operator a.\n\nNormalized function: For any function w, if\n\nf¥ War =1\n\nall space\nwhere the * denotes complex conjugate, then the function wp is normalized.\n\nOrthogonal functions: If, for functions f(x) and g(x)\n£0) goodx =0\n\nallspace\n\nthen f and g are orthogonal functions\nThe Development of Quantum Mechanics\nMax Planck 1900 Quantization of Oscillators in a Blackbody\n\nThe Planck distribution: oscillators in a \"blackbody\" could only have certain energies, E, which\nwere functions of their frequencies, v: E = nhv, with n = 0,1,2,3,... and h = 6.626x10-34 J-s. This\nexplained the blackbody radiation spectrum.\n\nAlbert Einstein 1905 Heat Capacities, Photons\n\nHeat capacities: used Planck\'s quantized oscillators to obtain a more correct expression for\ntemperature dependence of heat capacities -- a decrease of heat capacity with decrease in\ntemperature.\n\nPhotoelectric effect: proposed existence of \"photon\" of light with energy E = hv. This is the\ncorpuscular or \"particle\" theory of light (as contrasted with the older wave theory of light).\n\nNeils Bohr 1913 Quantized Model of Hydrogen-like Atom\nModel of the hydrogen-like atom based on the following assumptions:\n\n1. The Planck - Einstein hypothesis holds -- the difference in energy between two states\nequals the energy of the photon absorbed or emitted in a transition:\n\nAE = E2 - Ej = hv =f where h is Planck\'s constant, 1 = h/(2z), v is the linear\nfrequency (in Hz or s-!) and m = 2zv is the angular frequency (in radians/s).\n\nOnly discrete states are allowed for the electron. (All quantum chemists are discrete.)\n\n2. Ina given discrete state, the energy and angular momentum of the electron are\n\nconstant:\n-72e4\nmvr = nh En = 32n2e922n2 n= 1,2,3.,...\nBey 1\nAE = Ep? - En} = hv = 32026922 G2 - ny where n2 > n}\n\nThe Bohr model of the hydrogen-like atom:\n\na) gave theoretical values electron energies and transition frequencies (and wavelengths)\nin exact agreement with experiment for one-electron systems;\n\nb) failed for all but one-electron systems;\n\nc) predicted electrons to be traveling in circular orbits about the nucleus with fixed radii\ndependent on the energy.\nLouis de Broglie 1924 Matter Waves, Wave-Particle Duality\n\nEinstein had said that for light as a \"particle\", E = hv = hc/A; for a photon, the\nmomentum, p, will be given by p = mc; since Einstein had also said E = mc?, mc = E/e =\np, so\n\np=h/a or X= h/p\nDe Broglie said the same held true for particles of matter, that is\n= h/p = h/mv.\n\nThe is the de Broglie equation which allows us to calculate the wavelength associated\nwith any particle if its mass and velocity are known. This was confirmed experimentally\nwith the diffraction of electrons (1927) shown by Thomson, Davisson, and Germer.\n\nErwin Schro dinger and Werner Heisenberg 1925 Quantum Mechanics\n\nSchré dinger and Heisenberg independently developed the two equivalent formulations of\nquantum mechanics: wave mechanics and matrix mechanics. Wave mechanics has been\nmore accepted by chemists because of its more visual presentation of results and because\nits mathematics were less foreign than those of matrix mechanics. We can examine the\nuse of wave mechanics through the use of postulates, somewhat along the lines of the\nLaws of Thermodynamics.\n\n10\nQuantum Mechanics based on Fundamental Postulates\n\nDefinitions:\n\na) dynamical variable - any property of interest of the system which may vary with time\nb) observable - any experimentally measurable dynamical variable\n\nFor example, position, energy, a component of momentum at a point are all dynamical\nvariables. Quantum mechanics says some dynamical variables cannot be \"used\", such as\nmomentum at a point -- this is a result of the\n\nHeisenberg uncertainty principle: for any pair of complementary observables, x and y,\nthe product of the uncertainties in the observables is always equal to or greater than fi /2;\n\nAxAy = t/2\nWhat do the postulates do?\n1) Give a definition of the wave function w, and a physical interpretation of 1.\n\n2) Relate observables to operators; gives a prescription for going from expressions in\nclassical mechanics to the corresponding quantum mechanical expression. For example,\nposition, q, and time, t, remain the same, but the classical momentum changes:\n\n0\n= -ih—\nPx ax\n\n. . “ a)\nThe classical expression pg = MVq becomes the operator p= - na .\nq\n3) Define the Schré dinger equation:\n\nIf we have identical systems where ws is an eigenfunction of the operator a, then every\ntime you measure the property associated with o on one of the systems, you will get the\nvalue a, the eigenvalue. This property is fixed for all of the systems. As an example, for\nthe operator for the total energy, called the Hamiltonian - H,\n\nHs = Ests\nThe energy is the eigenvalue of the Hamiltonian.\n\n4) Define expectation values:\n\nIf the functions ws are not eigenfunctions of the operator under consideration, then a\nmeasurement of the property associated with a will yield a distribution of values whose\naverage, or expectation value, <a>, is given by\n\n11\nHere dt stands for the differential of all coordinates. Thus you cannot predict what exact\nvalue you will get when you measure the property corresponding to a, but only its\naverage.\n\n5) Prescribes time dependence of system, if any.\n\nThe method of applying the principles will be the same in all cases. Since we are most\ninterested in the energy of the system, we first obtain the Hamiltonian operator and then\nseek the eigenfunctions of this operator. The eigenvalues corresponding to these\nwavefunctions are the energies, or eigenvalues, of the system.\n\nThe Postulates of Quantum Mechanics\n\n1.\n\na) Any state of a dynamical system of N particles is described as fully as is possible by a\nfunction W (q1,q2,q3..-..qN,t) where wp is a function of the coordinates of each particle (q)\nand the time (t). If the observable properties of the system do not depend on the time, the\nsystem is in a stationary state. By itself, p has no readily discernable physical\ninterpretation.\n\nb) The product p*w dt (where * denotes complex conjugate and drt is the differential\nvolume element) is proportional to the probability of finding the system with q; between\nqi and q; + dqj, q2 between qo and dqjz, etc., at a specific time t. This product is called\nthe probability density. wy may be a complex function (contain an imaginary part); hence,\nthe probability density (a real quantity) contains the product of w with its complex\nconjugate w”.\n\nFor every observable property of the system, there exists a corresponding operator; the\nphysical properties of the observable are determined by the mathematical properties of its\nassociated operator. To obtain the operator from the classical expression for the\nobservable, write the classical expression in terms of coordinates, momenta, and time,\nthen do the following:\n\na) leave the time and coordinates as the are\n\nb) replace the momenta, pg, with the operators - ih = .\nq\n\nIf @ is an operator corresponding to the observable a, and one has a set of identical\nsystems in a state w, with w, and eigenfunction of a, then every time the quantity\ncorresponding to a is measured, the value ag will be obtained where\n\nAs = as Ws.\n\n12\n4. If a is an operator corresponding to the observable a, and you have a set of identical\n\nsystems with ws but ws is not an eigenfunction of a , then measuring the property\ncorresponding to @ on various identical systems will yield a distribution of values with\nthe average or expectation value <a> given by\n\n5. The time dependence of (x,t) is given by\n\nh aw (x,t)\n- LOO)\ni Ot ¥\r'),

Your final evaluation is a long presentation (Assignment 6), a 20 min.\npresenation of your thesis research topic.\n\nAssignments\n\nThe course involves three types of assignments: reading assignments, writing\nassignments and oral presentations.\n\nReading Assignmnets\n\nThere will be two key reading assignments in the course:\nThesis reading and critique: you will select a number of M.S. thesis doc-\numents from past Cal Poly M.S. in Computer Science students. You\nwill read these documents, and you will prepare and present your as-\nsessment /critique of them.\n\nRelevant literature: you will be asked to prepare a bibliography of academic\nliterature relevant to your thesis/research topic. You will then be asked\nto read a number of papers from your bibliography.\n\nWriting Assignments\n\nThe course will have the following writing assignments:\n\nResearch Blurb/Thesis Intro: you will write a succinct introduction to your\nresearch area. This introduction should provide an overview of the broad\nreasearch area within which you are conducting your thesis research and\nshould motivate your specific thesis research. As such, this text can be\nviewed as a draft of your thesis introduction section.\n\nExperimental design: you will come up with a validation framework for your\nthesis (creative part of the assignment) and present a short write-up de-\nscribing it (writing part of the assignmnet). This can eventually become\npart of the Validation section of your thesis.\n\nBackground/Related work writeup : based on your bibliography of re-\nlated work you will provide a succinct writeup detailing the background\ninformation relevant to your thesis research topic. This may later morph\ninto Related Work or Background sections of your thesis.\n\nOral Presentation Assignments\n\nYou will formally deliver two presentations in this course:\n\nShort presentation: A short (up to 5 mins) presentation describing the es-\nsense of your thesis research in terms accessible to your peers.\n\nLong(er) presentation: A longer (15-20 mins) presentation describing your\nthesis research in more technical terms. This may serve as a prototype of\nyour eventual thesis presenation.\n\nOther Assignments\nThere may be other assignments in the course:\ne M.S. Defense attendance. If any M.S. defenses are scheduled this\n\nquarter, we will attend them (ideally, I\'d want everyone to attend 1-2\ndefenses).\ne Peer reviews. Some class activities may involve peer reviews of material\nproduced by others (e.g., past theses) or by other students in the course\n(e.g., their wiki submissions).\n\n \n\nThese activities will count under the ”Course Participation” line from the\ngrading procedures table above.\n\nWeb Page\nClass web page can be found at\nhttp: //www.csc.calpoly.edu/~dekhtyar/590-Sprin2016\n\nThrough this page you will be able to access all class handouts including\nhomeworks, project information, reading materials and lecture notes (should\nthe latter be written).\n\nWiki\n\nWe will use a CSC 590 Github Wiki in this class for a variety of assignments.\n\nAll of you will have individual wiki pages, and will upload your work to them.\n\nAdditionally, you will contribute to the contents of other existing wiki pages.\nWe will set up the wiki during the first week of classes and you will get access\n\nto it by the end of the week.,\n\nStrike\n\nAs you might know, Cal Poly faculty, as well as the faculty at other CSU\ncampuses are represented for the purposes of collective bargaining by California\nFaculty Association (CFA), an affilliate union of SEIU, American Association\nof University Professors (AAUP), National Education Association (NEA) and\nCalifornia Teachers Association (CTA).\n\nDuring the 2015-2016 academic year CFA has engaged in collective bargain-\ning activities with the CSU adminstration on behalf of the CSU faculty. The\nCFA has asked for a 5% salary increase for all CSU faculty to help if not off-\nset, then at least somewhat minimize the financial hardships faced by the CSU\nfaculty over the past eight years of no stagnant salaries (complete with a 10%\nfurlough during one of these years).\n\nAt present the CFA is at an impasse with the CSU administration regarding\nthe salary negotiations. While this impasse can be resolved at any time, CFA\nhas used its right to call for a concerted action. As things stand now, CFA\nhas called for a CSU-wide strike to take place during the following\ndays:\n\ne April 13 — April 15\ne April 18 — April 19\nWe have one class scheduled during the announced strike days: on April 18\n(Monday).\n\nIf CFA and the CSU administration reach an agreement on faculty salaries,\nthe strike will be called off and our class will take place as usual.\n\nIf the agreement is not reached and the strike is on, you should expect\nthe following to happen:\n\ne No class on April 18.\n\ne Because the faculty who go on strike must stop all work-related activi-\nties, if I join the strike I will not respond to any work-related emails, and\nin fact, I will be unable to check my calpoly.edu email account. (Please\nnote that April 16 and April 17 are not strike days, so during these two\ndays, I may be able to check email and respond to it).\n\ne Faculty who go on strike will not be present on campus, except for picket\nlines.\n\ne You are not on strike in your capacity as Cal Poly students. What\nthis means is that while I may not be able to hold the classes, there\nmay be assignments that will have to be done by you during the strike\ndays. I promise no due dates for course assignments on any of the strike\ndays, but if the strike takes place, one or more assignments may be issued\nbefore the strike commences with due dates after the strike is over. The\nexpectation is that you will spend some of your time during the strike days\nworking on these assignments, even if I am unable to answer the questions\nyou might have about them. (We will try to make sure you have sufficient\ntime to resolve any questions related to these assignments prior to the\nstart of the strike).\n\ne Classes will resume as usual on Wednesday, April 20. Our next class will\ntake place on Monday, April 25.\n\nI understand how disruptive a week-long strike will be on your education\nand I apologize in advance for the negative impact on your education the strike\nmight have. At the same time, as far as preventing the strike, the ball is squarely\nin the court of the CSU administration. If you want the CSU administration to\nknow your thoughts concerning the faculty strike, I would like to encourage you\nto convey those thoughts - either directly, or through Cal Poly administration.\n\nFor more information concerning the strike, please see\n\nhttp: //www.calfac.org/item /faq-cfa-bargaining-possible-strike\nand\n\nhttp: //www.calfac.org/strike-411-students\n\non\nAcademic Integrity\n\nUniversity Policies\n\nCal Poly’s Academic Integrity policies are found at\nhttp: //www.academicprograms.calpoly.edu/academicpolicies/Cheating.htm\nIn particular, these policies define cheating as (684.1)\n\n“... obtaining or attempting to obtain, or aiding another to obtain\ncredit for work, or any improvement in evaluation of performance, by\nany dishonest or deceptive means.

Acknowledgement of an original au-\nthor or source must be made through appropriate references; i.e.,\nquotation marks, footnotes, or commentary.”\n\nUniversity policies state (684.2): “Cheating requires an “F” course grade and\nfurther attendance in the course is prohibited.” (appeal proces also outlined,\nsee the web site above for details.). Plagiarism, per university policies (684.4)\ncan be treated as a form of cheating, although a level of discretion is given to\nthe instructor, allowing the instuctor to determine the causes of plagiarism and\neffect other means of remedy.

There course\nwill have a midterm exam and a final exam. The tentative date for the midterm\nexam is May 7 (Tuesday) or May 9 (Thursday).\n\nThe date for the final exam is Tuesday, June 11, 4:10 - 7:00pm.\n\nBoth exams will be written tests designed to test your knowledge of the al-\ngorithms and data structures covered in the course.\nLabs, CHEM 441\n\nThe course is taught in concert with CHEM 441, Bioinformatics Applications.\nThe two courses discuss the field of bioinformatics from two different perspec-\ntives. CSC 448 is a course targeted at computing sciences majors (CSC, CPE,\nSE). It will concentrate on algorithms and software design and development for\nbioinformatics problems. CHEM 441 is targeted as life sciences and biotech-\nnology majors (BIO, BCHM, CHEM, BMED, ANSC). It concentrates on the\nbiological nature of the problems for which computational solutions are required,\nand on the use bioinformatics software in the field of biology.\n\nTeaching the courses in concert means the following:\n\ne Course content is coordinated between the CSC 448 (Alex Dekhtyar) and\nCHEM 441 (Anya Goodman) instructors.\n\ne All major hands-on laboratory assignments are shared between the two\ncourses. While the requirements, expectations and deliverables for the\nassignments will be different, the work on these assignments will be per-\nformed by multidisciplinary teams formed jointly out of students from\nboth courses.\n\nBoth classes are taught at the same time, with the labs periods being sched-\nuled in nearby labs.\n\nAll major labs will be performed in joint teams. Teams will be formed during\nthe first/second week of the classes, and will persist over the course of the\nquarter. The majority of the lab assignments is designed to contribute to a\nsingle overarching course project the students of CHEM 441 will be working on\n(hence, the team persistance).\n\nLab time will be split between lab periods designated for joint work between\nCSC 448 and CHEM 441 students and lab periods designated for independent\nsoftware development work by the CSC 448 subteams and independent work by\nCHEM 441 teams.\n\nThe major joint labs are:\n\n \n\n \n\nLab Number Lab Topic Lab Duration\n\nLab 1 Ice-breaking activities 1 class\n\nLab 2 Simple DNA analysis 1.5 weeks\n\nLab 3 Statstical analysis of DNA 1.5 weeks\n\nLab 4 Search for repeated sequences 1.5 weeks\n\nLab 5 MicroRNA search 1.5 weeks\n\nLab 6 Genome Annotation (alignment) 2 weeks\n\nLab 7 Poster 1 week\nHomeworks\n\nSome amount of paper-and-pencil homeworks is expected.\n\nCommunication\n\nThe class will have an official mailing list. The email address for the mailing\nlist is csc-448-01-2134@calpoly.edu. All students enrolled in the class are auto-\nmatically subscribed to the mailing list (using the email addresss that the CS\ndepartment has on file).\nWe will also have a joint mailing list for CSC 448/CHEM 441 students.\n\nI encourage questions during classtime and questions via email. My answers\nto email questions may be broadcast to the entire class via the mailing list, if the\nanswer may be relevant to everyone (e.g. a correction in a text of a handout,\nor a clarification of a homework problem), and may also appear on the web\npage. The questions can also be posted to the mailing list directly. The mailing\nlist will also be used for all annoucements related to the course. It is your\nresponsibility to read your class-related email. Failure to read email posted to\nthe mailing list cannot be used as an excuse in the class.\n\nWeb Page\nClass web page can be found at\nhttp: //www.csc.calpoly.edu/~dekhtyar/448-Spring2013\n\nThrough this page you will be able to access all class handouts including\nhomeworks, lab assignments, project information, lab/project data and lecture\nnotes.\n\nLinks to additional information, and notes and announcements will also be\nposted.\n\nPiazza\n\nTo facilitate information sharing within each team, we will be using Piazza. The\naddress for the Piazza web page for CSC 448/CHEM 441 is:\n\nhttps: //piazza.com/class#spring2013/csc448bi0441\n\nOnce the teams are organized, each team will have its own Piazza group, and\nwill be able to share documentation/software with the teammates.\n\nAcademic Integrity\nUniversity Policies\nCal Poly’s Academic Integrity policies are found at\nhttp: //www.academicprograms.calpoly.edu/academicpolicies/Cheating.htm\nIn particular, these policies define cheating as (684.1)\n\n“... obtaining or attempting to obtain, or aiding another to obtain\ncredit for work, or any improvement in evaluation of performance, by\nany dishonest or deceptive means.

Lab assign-\nments are to be completed by the appropriate units (individual, pair, group),\nand no code/solution-sharing between units is permitted. Students are encour-\naged to discuss class content among themselves but NOT in a manner that con-\nstitutes plagiarism and cheating as defined above (e.g., you can solve together\na problem from the textbook that had not been assigned in the homework, but\nyou should solve assigned problems individually).\r'),

This course will teach you the fundamentals for\nwriting your own computer graphics applications. This course requires substantial math and\nprogramming skills. Experience with C or C++ will be essential and experience with linear\nalgebra will be helpful. We will be using OpenGL and GLUT for graphics APIs, along with C or\nC++ to create computer graphics applications throughout the quarter. We will also be using\nGLSL. We will start the quarter working on linux (but it is fine for you to develop under other\noperating systems).\n\nAssignments:\n@ 2 mid-term exams (20% of final grade — 10% each)\n@ ~12 Lab exercises (12% of final grade)\n@ 4 substantial programming assignments (10% each of final grade)\n* GLUT, OpenGL & C++ applications\n@ One larger final programming project (25% of final grade)\n* of your choice (again using GLUT, OpenGL and C++)\n* project must be approved by the instructor (details to follow)\n@ Participation (3% of final grade)\n* attend class/ talk in class or office hours interaction\n\nDeadlines will be typically Tuesday before class but they will vary. Please see the program\ndescription for final details. There is a strict late policy for all assignments — if your program\nis late you will lose:\n\n¢ -20% within first 24 hours after deadline\n\n¢ -40% within 48 hours\n\n¢ -100% after 48 hours\nHowever, you get 2 *free* days for the entire quarter which can be applied to the four\nprogramming assignments only. You do not need to explain why you are using the days — these\ntwo late days will be automatically applied to any late assignments. After your two late days\nhave been used up, the late penalties apply.\n\nRequired Text: Chapters will be provided from a forthcoming book\n\nCheating: Although I encourage you to have lively discussions with one another, all work you\nhand in must be your own work. If your program or parts of your program are plagiarized\nfrom another student or unapproved source, you will fail the course and a letter will be put in\nyour file with Cal Poly Judicial Affairs.\nThe following schedule for the lectures and assignments may change\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nWeek 1 {1/3/12 Introduction — the graphics pipeline\n1/5/12 2D Coordinate systems (points + vectors)\nRead\nWeek 2 {1/10/12 ‘Vector math\nRead\n1/12/12 ‘Vector math + geometric transforms I\nRead\nWeek 3 {1/17/12 IMONDAY CLASSES — NO CLASS Program 1 due\nRead\n1/19/12 Geometric transforms II\nRead\nWeek 4 |[1/24/12 Geometric transforms & virtual trackball\nRead\n1/26/12 Lines, vectors, planes & meshes & Program 2 due\nhierarchical models\nRead\nWeek 5 {1/31/12 ‘Viewing transforms and Camera I\nRead\n2/2/12 Viewing transforms and Camera II\nWeek 6 = {2/7/12 review\nRead\n2/9/12 (Midterm 1 Program 3 due\nRead\nWeek 7 [2/14/12 Lighting and Shading I\nRead\n2/16/12 Lighting and Shading IT\nRead Final proj. proposals due\nWeek 8 [2/21/12 Texture mapping Program 4 due\nRead\n2/23/12 Scan conversion and line drawing Final project check-in\nWeek 9 = [2/28/12 Scan conversion, line drawing & polygon\nRead\n3/1/12 review Final project check-in\nWeek 10 {3/6/12 *guest lecture\nRead\n3/8/12 Midterm\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFinal 3/13/12 Tuesday 4:10-7:00pm Final Projects demo\r'),

In order to achieve this, students learn\nhow to analyze, design, and program intelligent agents of varying complexities. These\nagents gather information from their environment, convert it into a suitable internal\nrepresentation (which may be augmented with information provided by the designer or\nother sources), analyze their internal knowledge to determine suitable actions, and finally\nexecute some actions. More specifically, after successful completion of the course, students\nshould\n\ne know classical examples of artificial intelligence\n\n¢ be able to identify critical aspects of intelligence in humans and in computer-based\nsystems\n\ne know characteristics of programs and systems that can be considered \"intelligent\"\n\ne be familiar with the main problem solving methods used in AI programs\n\ne understand the use of heuristics in search problems and games\nknow a variety of ways to represent, process and retrieve knowledge and\ninformation\n\nknow the fundamentals of artificial intelligence programming techniques in a\nmodern programming language\n\nconsider ideas and issues associated with social technical, and ethical uses of\nsystems that involve artificial intelligence\n\nTextbooks\n\nThe following textbooks will be used in this course:\n\nArtificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach (Third Edition) by Stuart Russell and\nPeter Norvig; Prentice Hall, 2009. ISBN 978-0136042594.\n\nIt is available from the El Corral bookstore has the second edition together with a\nsample chapter of the third edition . You can also check\n\nhttp://isbn .nu/9780136042594 for prices of new and used copies at online bookstores\nlike Amazon, Abebooks.com, Half.com and a few others. While it is better to have\nthe newest edition of the textbook, much of the material covered in this class is also\nwell presented in the older editions. There are also international editions available; I\nassume that the contents will be the same, but I have not checked this.\nIntroduction to Artificial Intelligence by Wolfgang Ertel, Springer, 2011; ISBN\n978-0857292988. This is a shorter and significantly cheaper book, written by a\nformer colleague of mine. The German original was translated into English by Nate\nBlack, a CSC alum.\n\n \n\n \n\nThere is a column in the course schedule indicating the chapters in the book that\ncorrespond to a topic discussed in class. Students are expected to read the respective\nchapters before the topic is covered in class. For further reading, here are some more\nsuggestions:\n\nA comparison of AI text books by Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig.\n\nThe lecture notes from MIT\'s course on Artificial Intelligence are available through\ntheir OpenCourseWare project. The topics covered are similar to ours, and some of\nthe notes contain nice examples.\n\nAnother AI textbook with an agent-based perspective is Artificial Intelligence: A\nNew Synthesis by Nils J. Nilsson, Morgan Kaufmann, 1998, ISBN 1-55860-467-7.\nThe fourth edition of \"Artificial Intelligence - Structures and Strategies for Problem\nSolving\" by George F. Luger , Addison Wesley, 2008, ISBN 9780321545893 is\nbased on a more traditional approach to AI, with less emphasis on intelligent agents.\nA more philosophically oriented treatment of the major AI topics is Paradigms of\nArtificial Intelligence -- A Methodological and Computational Analysis by Achim\nHoffmann, Springer-Verlag, August 1998, ISBN 981-3083-97-2.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThere are also a few books on more practical aspects of AI programming and intelligent\nagents:\n\ne Programming Collective Intelligence Building Smart Web 2.0 Applications. Toby\nSegaran, August 2007, ISBN 10: 0-596-52932-5 ISBN 13: 9780596529321 O\'Reilly\n400 pages, $39.99 US.\n\ne This book is focused on Web applications like recommendation engines, and gives\nPython code samples for the underlying methods.\n\ne AI for Game Developers.

I reserve the right to\nchange the formula used. Please note that the project consists of several parts which will be\nevaluated separately. The project will be done in teams, and the performance of the team as\na whole will be graded unless there is a clear disparity in the contribution of the individual\nteam members. Should this be the case, I might ask for additional documentation like work\nsheets, email messages, or draft copies of documentation to evaluate individual\ncontributions.\n\nStudent scores will be made available via Blackboard. If you notice any discrepancies\nbetween an entry on Blackboard and the score indicated on the returned work, please let\nme know.\n\nAcademic Dishonesty and Cheating\n\nYou are expected to adhere to Cal Poly\'s Code of Student Conduct. Academic dishonesty\ncan be a serious offense. Any instances of cheating or plagiarism may be reported to the\ndepartment chair and the Office of Student Rights & Responsibilities (OSRR). The Cal\nPoly rules and policies are listed in the Cal Poly catalog as well as at the OSRR web site,\nhttp://www calpoly .edu/~osrr/index.html. If the rules are unclear or you are unsure of how\nthey apply, ask the instructor beforehand.\n\nWe may use programs or services like Moss to compare assignments within a section,\nacross all current sections of this class, and with old assignments. While such programs are\nnot perfect, they detect suspicious similarities even after replacement of variable names and\nother identifiers. In general, the use of program libraries is acceptable, but not if they\nprovide functionality whose implementation is the purpose of the lab or assignment. If you\nuse libraries you need to indicate this in the documentation. Unless explicitly stated,\nassignments and labs are to be done individually.\n\nTurning in work is presumed to be a claim of authorship unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n\n© 2011 Franz Kurfess Contact Me\r'),

During the course the students\nwill learn the basic concepts of data management, the principles of operation of\nrelational DBMS (Database Management Systems) and the principles of build-\ning database applications on top of relational DBMS. The students will study the\nSQL query language for relational data, and will learn how to use it to construct\nsoftware that relies on DBMS to manage its data. In addition, some theoretical\naspects of database management will be covered, as well as an overview of the\ninternal organization of the DBMS. Course labs will use Oracle DBMS.\nTexbook\n\nRequired: Database Systems: The Complete Book. H. Garcia-Molina, J.D.\nUllman, J.

Because of this,\nthe traditional 90-A, 80-B, 70-C grading schema does not work in my classes.\nHistorically, the A/B cutoff has been around 80-85%, while the B/C cutoff has\nbeen around 67-70%.\n\n \n\nCourse Policies\n\nExams\n\nThere will be a midterm exam and a final exam in the course.\nThe tentative date for the midterm is October 28(Friday), although if we are\nahead of the curve, we might schedule one on October 21 (Friday).\n\nThe final exam is scheduled (thankfully) for Monday, December 12, 4:10 -\n7:00pm.\n\nMake-up exams will not be given, unless there are extraordinary circum-\nstances present and I am notified in advance. The policy regarding the use of\ntextbooks and notes will be announced at least one week prior to each exam.\n\nHomeworks, Labs\n\nThe course will have 8-9 lab assignments, designed to let you test in practice\nwhat we have learned in class. Each lab assignment except will span multiple\nlab sessions. Most assignments will have a one-week span. The final lab is likely\nto be in a form of team mini project and it will be longer. Each lab assignment\nis due by the end of lab period on the due date (unless specified otherwise). You\nare welcome to work on the lab assignments outside the lab hours, however, lab\nperiod attendance is highly encouraged.\n\nMost lab assignments are individual work. We will have a pair programming\nlab to start the course, and a team mini project to end it. Groups/pairings are\nto be formed by you - I will only intervene if someone cannot find a group/pair,\nor if there is a hard-to-resolve issue that requires my attention. All members of\na team/pair will recieve the same grade for the assignment.\n\nIn addition to labs, a number of paper-and-pencil homeworks will be as-\nsigned. Homeworks will typically consist of problems taken from database text-\nbooks, or similarly styled problems. The main purpose of the homeworks is to\nprepare you for the written exams.\n\n \n\nLate Submissions\n\nAll assignments are due at classtime on the due date: homeworks - at the\nbeginning of the class (with grace period extending to the beginning of the lab\nperiod); lab assignments - at the end of the lab period. Any deviations from\nthese rules will be spelled out explicitly in the assignments.\n\nHomework/lab assignments submitted later than indicated above will be\nconsidered late submissions.\n\nIf paper-and-pencil homework solutions are distributed on the due date of\nthe homework, late homework submissions will not be accepted. Oth-\nerwise, late homeworks can be submitted during next 24 hours for a 10-30%\npenalty (the exact amount will depend on the submission time and the specific\ncircumstances). No homework submissions will be accepted afterwards.\n\nLate lab assignment submissions can be turned in before or at the beginning\nof the next lab period for a 10-30% penalty (the exact amount will depend\non the submission time and the specific cireumstances\'). No lab assignment\nsubmissions will be accepted after that.\n\n1The penalty will be larger if the gap between the two lab periods includes a weekend, and\nsmaller otherwise\nCommunication\n\nThe class has an official mailing lists. The email addresses for the mailing list\nis:\n\ncpe-365-01-2168@calpoly.edu\n\nAll students enrolled in the class are automatically subscribed to the mailing\nlist.\n\nI encourage questions during classtime and questions via email. My answers\nto email questions may be broadcast to the entire class via the mailing list, if the\nanswer may be relevant to everyone (e.g. a correction in a text of a handout,\nor a clarification of a homework problem), and may also appear on the web\npage. The questions can also be posted to the mailing list directly. The mailing\nlist will also be used for all annoucements related to the course.

Failure to read email posted to\nthe mailing list cannot be used as an excuse in the class.\n\nWeb Page\nClass web page can be found at\nhttp: //www.csc.calpoly.edu/~dekhtyar/365-Fall2016\n\nThrough this page you will be able to access all class handouts including\nhomeworks, project information and lecture notes (should the latter be written).\n\nLinks to web pages with additional information (such as CSLAB database\nsupport page) and important notes and announcements will also be posted.\n\nAcademic Integrity\n\nUniversity Policies\n\nCal Poly’s Academic Integrity policies are found at\nhttp: //www.academicprograms.calpoly.edu/academicpolicies/Cheating.htm\nIn particular, these policies define cheating as (684.1)\n\n“... obtaining or attempting to obtain, or aiding another to obtain\ncredit for work, or any improvement in evaluation of performance, by\nany dishonest or deceptive means. Cheating includes, but is not lim-\nited to: lying; copying from another’s test or examination; discussion\nof answers or questions on an examination or test, unless such discus-\nsion is specifically authorized by the instructor; taking or receiving\ncopies of an exam without the permission of the instructor; using or\ndisplaying notes, ”cheat sheets,” or other information devices inap-\npropriate to the prescribed test conditions; allowing someone other\nthan the officially enrolled student to represent same.”\nPlagiarism, per University policies is defined as (684.3)\n\n“... the act of using the ideas or work of another person or persons\nas if they were one’s own without giving proper credit to the source.\nSuch an act is not plagiarism if it is ascertained that the ideas were\narrived through independent reasoning or logic or where the thought\nor idea is common knowledge. Acknowledgement of an original au-\nthor or source must be made through appropriate references; i.e.,\nquotation marks, footnotes, or commentary.”\n\nUniversity policies state (684.2): “Cheating requires an “F” course grade and\nfurther attendance in the course is prohibited.” (appeal process is also outlined,\nsee the web site above for details.). Plagiarism, per university policies (684.4)\ncan be treated as a form of cheating, although a level of discretion is given to\nthe instructor, allowing the instuctor to determine the causes of plagiarism and\neffect other means of remedy. It is the obligation of the instructor to inform the\nstudent that a penalty is being assessed in such cases.\n\n \n\nCourse Policies\n\nAll homeworks are to be completed by each student individually. Lab assign-\nments are to be completed by the appropriate units (individual, pair, group),\nand no code/solution-sharing between units is permitted. Students are encour-\naged to discuss class content among themselves but NOT in a manner that con-\nstitutes plagiarism and cheating as defined above (e.g., you can solve together\na problem from the textbook that had not been assigned in the homework, but\nyou should solve assigned problems individually).\n\non\r'),

Koffman (4\" Edition)\n\n \n\nRecommended Text(s)\n\nThe C Programming Language, Second Edition by Kernighan and Ritchie, Prentice Hall,\nInc.,\n\n \n\nPolicies and Advisories\n\n1) This course will have a common final scheduled for either Tuesday or Wednesday from\n7-10:00pm of finals week — no other finals will be given — if you can’t make this\ncommon final time don’t take this class!\n\n2) The College of Engineering requires proof of unusual circumstances to withdraw from a\ncourse after the eighth day of the quarter.\n\n3) Projects must be submitted on or before the date and time specified in the assignment to\nreceive credit. Late projects will not be accepted. However, students each have two free\ndays which may be used during the quarter for any of the programming assignments.\n\n4) There are no makeup exams or quizzes except in documented and extreme emergencies.\n\n5) Acourse grade of incomplete is given only for reasons acceptable to the university.\n6) Plagiarism on projects will result in all involved students (student(s) who copied and\nstudent(s) who were copied from) being failed from the course. In addition, a report of\nthe incident will be reported to the university’s Judicial Affairs department, which may\nresult in being dismissed from the university. Please note that all programs will be\nchecked automatically for plagiarism.\n\nLecture and Lab Attendance\n\nAttendance and participation in the course is mandatory. Participation includes responding\nto questions in class, lab or office hours and making observations or discussing course\nmaterial in class, lab or office hours.\n\nReading and Homework\n\nYou are expected to read the assigned chapters prior to class. Not all material in the reading\nwill be covered in lecture or lab but you are still responsible for knowing it for quizzes and\nexams. Come to class prepared with any questions from the reading that you would like\naddressed.\n\nThere is no graded homework. However, make sure you are familiar with the concepts in the\nchapter summaries and comfortable with the questions and exercises at the end of each\nassigned chapter. Don’t be surprised if you see material like this on your quizzes and exams.\n\nLab and Lab Exercises\n\nRegular and frequent labs will be assigned and collected each week and, together, will\ncomprise 15% of your course grade. The three hours of scheduled lab time each week is the\nprimary time your instructor will be available for questions and assistance — make wise use\nof this resource! You are expected to work on the lab exercises during your scheduled lab\ntime plus as much additional time as necessary to complete them. The lab exercises are\ndesigned to familiarize you with some of the concepts necessary to complete your projects\nand to help you do well on quizzes and exams. You may work on your projects in lab after\ncompleting all currently assigned labs.\n\nIMPORTANT: No late labs will be accepted.\nNOTE: You may collaborate on lab certain exercises (as specified).\n\nProjects\nThere will be six projects over the quarter that, together, comprise 29% of your course\ngrade. Projects will consist of analysis, design, documentation, and program development\nand will be graded based on their functionality as well as the quality of the implementation —\n\nincluding coding style, efficiency, and documentation.\n\nIMPORTANT: No late projects will be accepted.\nCAUTION: You are required to complete your projects individually (unless clearly\nspecified in the assignment!). You may discuss general concepts with others inside and\noutside of class, including tutors, but you must do the specific work on the projects on your\nown. Do not even look at another student’s project code or allow another student to see\nyours. Any project, in whole or part, which is suspected of being the work of more than one\nstudent, will be considered plagiarism. Projects will be compared using software that can\nreliably detect similarities among programs. See the Policies and Advisories section above\nregarding the penalties for plagiarism.\n\nQuizzes and Exams\n\nThere will be several separate lecture and lab quizzes, one lecture midterm, and one common\nlecture final. The midterm and final exams will be cumulative and comprehensive and will\ncover material covered in lecture, your text, as well as programming skills of analysis,\ndesign, and implementation used in your labs and projects. Lab quizzes will focus on\nprogramming skills and knowledge acquired primarily, though not exclusively, from labs and\nprojects.\n\nIMPORTANT: No makeup quizzes or exams will be given. The lecture final is a common\nfinal and will be held on Tuesday or Wednesday from 7-10PM of finals week.\n\nNOTE (Unless otherwise specified):\n\nThe lecture quizzes, midterm, and final are closed-note and closed-book.\nLab quizzes are closed-note, closed-source, closed-web, but open-book.\n\nGrading\n\nThe following table presents the percentage value of all graded items based on a course total\nof 100%:\n\n \n\nGraded Item Each Total Length (Each)\n\nParticipation N/A 3% N/A\n\nSix projects 2-5% 29% N/A\n\nNine weekly labs 1-2% 15% N/A\n\nFour lab quizzes 4% 16% ~50 minutes\n\nTwo lecture quizzes 1% 2% 15-50 minutes\n\nOne lecture midterm N/A 10% ~50 minutes (Cumulative)\n\nOne lecture final N/A 25% 170 minutes (Cumulative)\nHonesty\n\nThe following honor statement will be expected for all programs, quizzes, exams and\nclass work:\nI have not taken unfair advantage of\nanyone in the Cal Poly computer science community.

CSC\n468 is NOT a prerequisite!\n\nSome of you have taken CSC 466, Knowledge Discovery From Data, which can\nbe viewed as a precursor to this course. To allow for extra enrollment CSC\n466 is NOT a prerequisite to this course either. We will spend some time\nearly in the quarter to recap CSC 466 material that is necessary for the course,\nbut beyond that, we will concentrate on new material that should be equally\naccessible with and without CSC 466 experience.\n\nExams\n\nThe course has no exams. Instead, there is a quarter-long team project with a\nnumber of deliverables (proposal, presentation, report), which accounts for 50%\nof the course grade.\n\nThe final exam time is reserved for final team presentations.\n\nIn-Class Presentation\n\nEach student in the course will at some point prepare and give a presentation\non a topic related to the area of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery from\nData. This assignment will also have a number of deliverables (topic choice,\nbibliography, wiki page/lecture notes, presentation) spread over the quarter.\n\nTwo possible styles of presentation: (a) pick a sub-area or a problem in the\narea of KDD and prepare a survey of the state-of-the-art in it; (b) pick a specific\npaper and discuss in-depth its contribution to the field.\n\nWhile each student will be judged individually on this assignment, I will\nallow collaboration (within reason - two-three people per serious topic is ok) in\npreparation of this assignment. Note, that if you are working on this assignment\njointly with someone, you will have to cover proportionally more material.\nHomeworks, Programming Assignments\n\nWhile the course does not have an intensive lab-based hands-on component, we\nmay have one-to-three small programming assignments in the course to ensure\nthat you’ve had a chance to implement some of the important data mining\ntechniques. (The only other programming in the course may/will come from\nyour project).\n\nCommunication\n\nThe class will have an official mailing list. The email address for the mailing\nlist is csc-560-01-2098@calpoly.edu. All students enrolled in the class are auto-\nmatically subscribed to the mailing list (using the email addresss that the CS\ndepartment has on file).\n\nI encourage questions during classtime and questions via email. My answers\nto email questions may be broadcast to the entire class via the mailing list, if the\nanswer may be relevant to everyone (e.g. a correction in a text of a handout,\nor a clarification of a homework problem), and may also appear on the web\npage. The questions can also be posted to the mailing list directly. The mailing\nlist will also be used for all annoucements related to the course. It is your\nresponsibility to read your class-related email.

Cheating includes, but is not lim-\nited to: lying; copying from another’s test or examination; discussion\nof answers or questions on an examination or test, unless such discus-\nsion is specifically authorized by the instructor; taking or receiving\ncopies of an exam without the permission of the instructor; using or\ndisplaying notes, ”cheat sheets,” or other information devices inap-\npropriate to the prescribed test conditions; allowing someone other\nthan the officially enrolled student to represent same.”\n\n \n\nPlagiarism, per University policies is defined as (684.3)\n\n“... the act of using the ideas or work of another person or persons\nas if they were one’s own without giving proper credit to the source.\nSuch an act is not plagiarism if it is ascertained that the ideas were\narrived through independent reasoning or logic or where the thought\nor idea is common knowledge. Acknowledgement of an original au-\nthor or source must be made through appropriate references; i.e.,\nquotation marks, footnotes, or commentary.”\n\nUniversity policies state (684.2): “Cheating requires an “F” course grade and\nfurther attendance in the course is prohibited.” (appeal process is also outlined,\nsee the web site above for details.). Plagiarism, per university policies (684.4)\ncan be treated as a form of cheating, although a level of discretion is given to\nthe instructor, allowing the instuctor to determine the causes of plagiarism and\neffect other means of remedy. It is the obligation of the instructor to inform the\nstudent that a penalty is being assessed in such cases.\n\n  \n\nCourse Policies\n\nAll homeworks are to be completed by each student individually. Lab assign-\nments are to be completed by the appropriate units (individual, pair, group),\nand no code/solution-sharing between units is permitted. Students are encour-\naged to discuss class content among themselves but NOT in a manner that con-\nstitutes plagiarism and cheating as defined above (e.g., you can solve together\na problem from the textbook that had not been assigned in the homework, but\nyou should solve assigned problems individually).');
